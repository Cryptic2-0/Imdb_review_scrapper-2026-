Excellent world and character building, with outstanding set pieces. Every single actor played their roles to perfection! Askhay Khanna stands out the most. However, as others mentioned, the role of Ranveer was not to stand out in the first place, and the director and actor executed that perfectly!",275,
rw11006552,gk303007,,"After a long time, a good espionage movie","Well, well, well... Pathan, War 2, Singham, and so on and so forth. Pathan was Shahrukh&#39;s comeback and we all know his nuances: he drives a movie on his shoulders. Yet, when it came to spy thriller, it was frankly so-so. Then we all know star studded movies like the lastest Singham and War 2... There&#39;s only masala with heavy star cast and a very, very little storyline or nothing on the spy topic. I can definitely say, they were mass movies relying on starcast and some CGI.<br/><br/>So then comes Dhurandhar. Not to say again but a heavy star studded movie with spy and espionage elements. But the difference, the stars gave phenomenal performances, including the young lady Saira and our own Rakesh Bedi. While everyone applaused Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal and ofcourse Ranveer Singh, I felt these two side characters were equally good in whatever roles they were offered.<br/><br/>Now coming to spy world. The movie showcases what&#39;s there, is there. How it works, how things topple upside down due to a slight mistake, or how you may have to take chances, heavy chances to get something done. When you have one and only aim, your chances heavily rely on your guts and brain. Because be it or not, a rotten apple in a crate may leave its rottenness in other apples.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie is shown with the point of view of Indian forces, and some actual incidents, that blend with the overall sentiments and anger of a viewer.<br/><br/>Again, there is some gore, but not so much and elaborated like movie Animal. But not so less that you can watch with kids.<br/><br/>I did feel little glitches here and there but overall, a wonderful movie. And yes, I am waiting for the next part.<br/><br/>On a side note. The movie is long, but you won&#39;t yawn anytime during its running time.",197,

rw11007411,skmenon1993,,DHURANDHAR EXPERIENCE 🔥🔥🔥🔥,"A spy action movie with a runtime of 3 hrs 34 minutes approx, it&#39;s engrossing without a single moment of boredom, thanks to the robust screenplay and casting of talented performers. Director Aditya Dhar has been successful in ensuring that each character leaves an indelible mark on the viewers.<br/><br/>It&#39;s not solely a Ranveer Singh show, as the director has ensured each character has a memorable presence. R Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, Akshay Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, and Ranveer Singh deliver performances akin to a north Indian person savoring an authentic south Indian meal, with each bite providing satisfaction. Akshay Khanna, who won hearts with Aurangzeb in Chaava, has again impressed as Rehman Dakait in Dhurandhar. His swag, look, and dialogue delivery are mind-blowing. As the movie progresses, Sanjay Dutt brings a new gear, accelerating the pace with his enjoyable screen presence. R Madhavan and Arjun Rampal have limited screen time but make their presence felt. Sara Arjun delivers a decent performance as the lady love. Ranveer Singh&#39;s character development is amazing to watch, and his mass performance will be eagerly anticipated in the second part.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is astounding, perfectly capturing the essence of Dhurandhar. Sashwat Sachdev&#39;s score and music blend seamlessly with the movie&#39;s tone. The placement of old Bollywood classics in certain situations is entertaining and thrilling. Vikash Nowlakha&#39;s cinematography is commendable, and Shivkumar V Panicker&#39;s editing is sharp.",151,
rw11007366,jonny78,,this will change indian cinema,"Intelligent writing, peak performances, gritty and realistic action. After such a long time, mainstream bollywood finally has a movie which is truly cinema.<br/><br/>It&#39;s no simple task to construct a nearly 4 hour long movie without losing your audience, yet dhurandhar manages to do exactly that. In fact, the runtime serves as a strength, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in such a dense, complicated, and dark world.<br/><br/>I say this will change indian cinema because the film is just so thoughtfully built and so different at the same time. It feels like an experimental take on commercial cinema. There&#39;s so much aura farming, but dhar&#39;s clever script adds a classy weight to them that just isn&#39;t present in other bwood flicks.<br/><br/>There are some truly disturbing scenes here, in particular the scene for the 26/11 attack. The shock, the disgust, the sadness. I don&#39;t think a film has made me feel so angry in such a long time. Another scene involving arjun rampal&#39;s character is straight out of a horror movie. The 18 rating is definitely justified.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t miss this masterpiece.",129,
rw11007074,itzimraan,,"Emotion that lingers, action that erupts","The world of Dhurandhar is as mesmerizing as it is dangerous, with every corner of Karachi rendered in cinematic precision. Ranveer Singh delivers a layered performance that anchors the audience amid escalating threats and moral dilemmas. Director Dhar crafts sequences where strategic planning meets brutal action, keeping viewers perpetually on edge. The supporting cast contributes significantly, fleshing out a realistic criminal ecosystem. Cinematography and editing combine to maintain tension, while the score punctuates key moments. The narrative&#39;s blend of action, politics, and human drama makes the film a truly immersive experience.",114,
rw11006323,DevanshD-14,,Reasons you should watch it in cinemas,"The movie absolutely stands on top of other Bollywood movies in the year 2025 , the movie has it all , great acting, great story, a unique storytelling. The movie is undoubtedly long, but it doesn&#39;t feel stretched, the movie has been targeted for violence, but in my opinion , the violence is natural and necessary, we don&#39;t have unwanted violence like movies like animal or gangs of Wasseypur . The movie can be criticised only if you have a personal bias against it already , overall I&#39;ll suggest you to give the film a try and watch it without any bias , I am sure you&#39;ll like it.",118,
rw11001567,HitYaFlop_MovieWorld,,"A Grand, Ambitious Spectacle Powered by Stellar Performances","Aditya Dhar&#39;s Dhurandhar arrives as a bold, painstakingly mounted espionage thriller that thrives on scale, ambition, and sheer cinematic craft. It is a film that demands patience for its towering 214-minute runtime, but richly rewards those who stay with it. With top-notch production values, memorable set pieces, and some of the finest performances of the year, Dhurandhar stands tall as a big-screen experience meant to be felt as much as watched.<br/><br/>Inspired by true events, Dhar&#39;s story is inherently gripping. The screenplay is layered and compelling, especially in how it maps the journey of an ordinary Indian man who infiltrates the heart of Pakistan&#39;s political machinery. The tension is relentless, yet the storytelling never becomes loud or preachy. However, the writing does stretch thin in the first half. Aditya Dhar dialogues are passionate, often theatrical, and suit the film&#39;s soaring tone.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is packed with sequences that are crafted for maximum impact. The infiltration episodes are particularly thrilling sharp, suspenseful, and rooted in strategy rather than convenient heroism. The intermission arrives at a nail-biting turning point, leaving audiences gasping. Post-interval, Hamza&#39;s descent into madness is exceptionally staged. The finale, a brutal and emotionally charged fight sequence, serves as a fitting crescendo. The only major drawback: the length. At nearly 3 hours and 34 minutes, the film demands more endurance than necessary. A tighter edit could have easily elevated its impact.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers one of the most outstanding performances of his career. He inhabits the character with remarkable intensity and vulnerability. Akshaye Khanna is phenomenal, expressing oceans through the subtlest shifts in his eyes. Sanjay Dutt is electrifying, commanding, and immensely watchable. Arjun Rampal, though limited in screen time, makes every moment count. R. Madhavan is terrific, leaving a lasting impact with his portrayal. Sara Arjun makes a decent debut, though her chemistry with Ranveer feels oddly underdeveloped. Rakesh Bedi, Gaurav Gera, Naveen Kaushik, and Danish Pandor round out the supporting cast with assured performances.<br/><br/>Music is a mixed bag but effective. The title track is already a sensation. &quot;Ishq Jalakar - Karvaan&quot; emerges as the standout. &quot;Gehra Hua&quot; is soothing and well-placed. Cinematography is spectacular, the frames are rich, atmospheric, and visually arresting, making the film feel even larger than its scale. The action Choreography is gritty, dynamic, and rooted in physical realism. A gripping spectacle that could have been a masterpiece with tighter editing.<br/><br/>Direction 3.5/5

rw11005398,raghav-75870,,Best of all time,"Dhurandhar&quot; packs a powerful punch - a gritty, high-stakes spy thriller that drags you deep into the murky underworld of Karachi with style, tension and spectacle. Directed by Aditya Dhar, it follows Indian agent Hamza (Ranveer Singh) as he embeds himself deep within the mafia network of Karachi&#39;s notorious Lyari gang, attempting to dismantle terror operations from within.<br/><br/>From the outset, the film builds a potent atmosphere - dank alleys, ominous conspiracies, and a mounting sense of danger that never quite lets go. The cinematography, drenched in shadow and sharp contrasts, and the stirring background score - sometimes throbbing with urgency, sometimes hauntingly minimal - elevate ordinary frames into moments of nail-biting suspense.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh&#39;s performance is perhaps the greatest strength of the film: he plays Hamza with restraint and intensity, letting silence and subtle gestures speak louder than grand dialogues. Supporting cast members - from villains to allies - also deliver convincingly, making the world of &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; immersive and convincingly dangerous.<br/><br/>That said, the film does have its flaws. At three and a half hours, the runtime occasionally drags, and certain sequences - especially in the second half - feel overdrawn or repetitive. The gritty violence sometimes feels gratuitous, and a few plot threads seem more like setup for a sequel than satisfying arcs in themselves.<br/><br/>Despite those drawbacks, &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; works when it matters - for its ambition, its mood, and its commitment to telling a volatile story with conviction. It may not be perfect, but it&#39;s bold, intense, and rarely dull. For viewers who appreciate raw, uncompromising thrillers with emotional weight and real-world resonance, this is a ride worth taking. Amazing.",107,
rw11002190,amansingh-05354,,A breathtaking journey through gangster politics,"First of all I would like to salute the direction and storytelling of this movie. This type of story telling has not been seen before in bollywood. The music mashup, bgm and intro of every character was top notch. First half had all the cuisines for perfect build up for all the characters and story. In Second half all that build up explodes and gives great fight sequence, music, and goosebumps moment. After interval the story just flows and you won&#39;t feel like it&#39;s been 3:30 hours.<br/><br/>Final conclusion: Just don&#39;t miss this masterpiece if you are cinema lover, you can&#39;t afford to miss this type of storytelling.",151,
rw11004709,imrajneesh,,A gritty masterpiece that redefines the Indian spy genre,"If Uri: The Surgical Strike was the roar, Dhurandhar is the bite. Aditya Dhar has returned with a spy thriller that does not just rely on loud patriotism but backs it up with grit, intelligence, and a scale that Indian cinema rarely attempts. Clocking in at over three hours, it is a marathon of a film, but one that leaves you breathless rather than exhausted.<br/><br/>This is the Ranveer Singh we have been waiting for. As the covert operative Hamza Ali Mazari, Singh strips away his usual high-energy flamboyance to deliver a performance of simmering intensity. He is quiet, lethal, and emotionally vulnerable. Whether he is navigating the treacherous lanes of Karachi or breaking down in a rare moment of solitude, he anchors the film with a maturity that defines the second act of his career.<br/><br/>While Ranveer is the soul, Akshaye Khanna is the electrifying current running through the narrative. As the antagonist Rehman Dakait, Khanna is terrifyingly calm and intellectual, proving once again why he is one of the most underutilized actors in the industry. The face-off scenes between Singh and Khanna are masterclasses in tension, relying on psychological warfare rather than just explosions.<br/><br/>What stands out most is the technical brilliance. The film respects the intelligence of the audience, weaving a complex web of espionage involving historical stakes without feeling like a history lesson. The hand-to-hand combat is visceral and realistic, avoiding the gravity-defying stunts often seen in the genre. Shashwat Sachdev&#39;s background score is a character in itself - pounding and relentless during the action, yet haunting during the emotional beats.<br/><br/>Is it long? Yes. But the runtime is justified by the depth of the world-building. Dhurandhar is a mass entertainer with class sensibilities - a rare beast that satisfies the action junkies and the cinephiles alike. It is a high-octane saga that cements Aditya Dhar as a master of the war-spy genre. A must-watch for anyone who loves grounded, intense cinema.",102,
rw11001220,rashidhusain,,High octane spy thriller,"A must watch movie if you are a fan of intense spy thrillers. You&#39;re going to love it.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a powerhouse performance and is absolutely on fire.<br/><br/>His performance alone is enough to watch movie.<br/><br/>The film dives deep into espionage, underworld infiltration, and raw patriotism with tremendous intensity and swagger. Although the runtime feels a bit long at times, the gripping narrative and high-voltage execution keep you engaged throughout.",145,
rw11006055,milanjolly,,Blockbuster movie. Must watch.,"I initially thought the movie would have unrealistic action scenes to glorify the spy. But I was taken aback by the meticulously well done world building of Pakistan and Lyari. It showed the mindset of mafia, terrorists and pakistan&#39;s intelligence agency very well and which is reality grounded. Pakistan is historically known to attack India and torture the captured military personnel brutally and in an inhumane way. The movie doesn&#39;t shy away to show that brutal side of Pakistan. The actors gave a fabulous performance, particularly Akshay Khanna and Ranveer Singh.<br/><br/>This movie was a treat to watch. I would recommend every Indian who isn&#39;t delulu left wing but actually cares for the nation regardless of whether they are left or right wing to watch this movie.",72,
rw11001392,ranjitclimb,,Impact full,"Dhurandhar is a strong and engaging film that leaves a lasting impression through its powerful performances and well crafted story. The movie keeps you connected from start to finish without unnecessary complications, and the emotional weight of each character adds depth to the overall experience.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna stands out instantly. His calm yet intense way of acting gives the film a very solid foundation. He doesn&#39;t need loud moments to create impact his expressions, timing, and controlled performance speak for themselves. Every time he appears on screen, the scene feels more serious and meaningful.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt brings his natural authority and experience to the film. His presence adds a sense of strength and maturity to the storyline. He plays his role with a balanced mix of power and emotion, making the character believable and memorable without overacting.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal contributes strongly with a very composed and focused performance. He adds a sense of mystery and depth, and his character holds the audience&#39;s attention throughout. Rampal&#39;s acting feels effortless yet very effective, helping maintain the film&#39;s intense tone.<br/><br/>The biggest highlight, however, is Ranveer Singh as the spy. Ranveer fits the role perfectly. His energy, expressions, and emotional range show how much thought he has put into understanding the character. He plays a spy who carries both responsibility and inner conflict, and he brings this out in a very natural way. His action scenes look real, and his emotional moments feel honest. Ranveer&#39;s performance is strong enough to uplift the film on many levels.<br/><br/>The direction and storytelling are simple but impactful, keeping the focus on characters rather than unnecessary twists. The pacing is smooth, and the background music supports the tension in the right moments.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a well made, engaging, and powerful film. With strong acting from Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, and an excellent performance by Ranveer Singh, it becomes a movie worth watching for anyone who enjoys intense and meaningful cinema.",128,
rw11004025,vinay-93622,,Awesomely thought and scripted movie,"Amazed to see a brilliant movie coming from Aditya Dhar, which is well scripted and offers you a cinematic experience.<br/><br/>It showcase the journey of weak Indian government in early 2000 against terrorism ; and how RAW launches a brilliant plan to infiltrate Pakistani mafia.<br/><br/>Akshya Khanna will blow your mind with subtle act. You will find him heroic<br/><br/>A must watch in theatres only !",83,
rw11006480,pranayjalvi,,"Started strongly, but falters at places","Dhurandhar opens with a jolt. The film throws you straight into the brutality of its historical backdrop, staging the violence
with a kind of cold intensity that doesn&#39;t letup. The story dives into the world of undercover operations, betrayal, and the
constant tension of living behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>The performances are easily the strongest pillar here. Ranveer Singh handles the lead role with solid control, especially in the
heavier moments, though the film never lets us truly get under his skin. The real standout is Akshaye Khanna as Rehman
Dakait. He barely speaks, yet his eyes carry entire paragraphs. Every expression lands like a threat, and he steals the frame
without even trying. I personally felt Sanjay Dutt as SP Aslam as the weaker character, with no impactful dialogue or presence on the screen.<br/><br/>Technically, Dhurandhar is an impressive film. The background score keeps tightening the rope around the audience, although I didn&#39;t feel it synced every time with the scene. The cinematography was good, however the direction and editing could have been better. A lot of choppy editing was noticeable throughout the movie. The camera movement while decent throughout the movie, was awkward on certain occasions. The use of real footage of 26/11 conversation was something surprising as well as heavily convincing.<br/><br/>But the film collapses under its own weight. There are too many characters, too many arcs, and too many threads fighting for attention. With the narrative jumping around so much, there&#39;s little emotional connection with the protagonist or his
mission. It&#39;s hard to care whether he succeeds or fails when the film doesn&#39;t slow down enough to let us live with him.<br/><br/>The romance between Ranveer Singh and Sara Arjun is easily the weakest part of the film. The chemistry felt both awkward as well as forced. Everytime there scene appeared, it kinda pulled me out of the real narrative.<br/><br/>The violence, while impressive in execution, sometimes crosses into excess. There are moments that feel gruesome just for the sake of being gruesome, adding shock but not substance. The pacing was another concern. The film was long by atleast 30 minutes due to various unnecessary subplots and I felt it could have been wrapped in 3 hrs with a tighter grip on the story.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is an ambitious and technically strong movie, that works mostly due to it&#39;s premise and great performances, however is bloated by uneven storytelling that loses it&#39;s grip on the way.<br/><br/>My Rating : 3.5/5.",17,
rw11006261,imdbfan-6010566564,,Trauma in the name of Cinema,"Text: Went to watch Dhurandar and honestly... I regret it. What an unbearable stretch of a movie. Two words: Senseless. Pathetic. A spy agent enters Pakistan, instantly becomes famous, convinces a politician to marry his daughter. Like seriously??? Is being a spy this easy now? Where&#39;s the realism? Where&#39;s the logic? Who approved this script? The story writing, editing, and screenplay feel like torture - long, dragged, and nowhere engaging. The plot tries to be &quot;mass patriotic thriller&quot; but ends up looking like WhatsApp-forward level fiction. Only one saving grace: Akshaye Khanna - the only actor who even tries to keep this disaster alive. Without him, the movie would collapse in the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Final Verdict If you love your time, your money, and your mental peace - skip this film. It&#39;s not entertainment, it&#39;s cinematic trauma.",17,
rw11001939,aman_tewathia,,Blood in Shadows,"It&#39;s brutal, uncompromising, and unapologetically hard-edged. Perfectly assembled cast. Each actor embodies their role with precision. Powerhouse performance from each character. Together, they elevate the films from mere action into a character driven saga. Strong background score becomes part of the story.",74,
rw11004655,khannadir-83584,,A Milestone in Indian Spy Cinema,"Dhurandhar is nothing short of a landmark in Indian espionage filmmaking. Bold, sharp, and unapologetically intense, the film elevates the spy genre in ways Bollywood has rarely attempted. What sets it apart is its commitment to gritty realism, its depiction of covert operations, high-stakes intelligence work, and the psychological toll on field agents feels far more grounded than the glossy, larger-than-life approach seen in many mainstream spy franchises.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s portrayal of a hostile intelligence adversary, modeled through its fictionalized spy agency antagonists, is brutal, raw, and narratively effective. Where some commercial films opt for sanitization or melodrama, Dhurandhar leans fully into the darker shades of espionage, using tension and moral ambiguity to drive the story forward.<br/><br/>The screenplay is exceptional. Real-world inspired incidents are woven seamlessly into the narrative, creating a sense of authenticity that never feels forced. Every subplot, every twist, and every backstory merges into a cohesive whole without a single jarring bump. It&#39;s rare to see such meticulous structuring in Bollywood thrillers.<br/><br/>The background score deserves special recognition. It heightens the suspense without overwhelming the scenes, striking the perfect balance between cinematic flair and subtle atmospheric tension. The action sequences, too, are a standout-brutal, tightly choreographed, and refreshingly devoid of unnecessary slow motion or over-the-top heroics.<br/><br/>In a genre often dominated by style over substance, &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; proves that Indian cinema can deliver espionage storytelling that is both artistically rich and thrillingly raw. It&#39;s a must-watch for fans of realistic spy dramas and a benchmark future Indian films in this genre will be measured against.",65,
rw11005865,bajajgaurav,,The best espionage film in Indian cinema.,"I do not even know where to start but I will try my best to give it a shot.<br/><br/>The thing is that we have abused words like greatest, masterpiece, generational and blockbuster to an extent where they mean nothing anymore and we have thrown them at so many empty mediocre films that when something real arrives we do not have the vocabulary left to honour it. Because of that inflation of praise I do not know how to give justice through words to something that actually deserves reverence.<br/><br/>All I can honestly say is that every Indian should watch this film because Dhurandhar is not just any film, it is one of the greatest cinematic experiences of recent times and unquestionably the best espionage film in Indian cinema.<br/><br/>The performances are frighteningly brilliant because these people are not acting. They are breathing the consequences of history. Akshaye Khanna does not perform, he embodies Rehman Dakait, one of the finest actors this country has ever seen. Ranveer Singh reminds you that regardless of how loud, messy or chaotic he is as a public figure he is a generational actor. Arjun Rampal, Sanjay Dutt, R Madhavan, Rakesh Bedi and Sara Arjun every single one of them delivers with terrifying precision.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar, easily one of the best directors right now, deserves to be celebrated because he has created something that deserves cultural recognition. We celebrate average films with loud voices but this is the kind of work that should be remembered. I am genuinely glad that this story is being told in two parts because one film could never have carried the weight of this narrative or the tension of this experience.<br/><br/>There is a moment in this film where they play the real recordings from 26/11 attacks, the real conversations between the handlers and the terrorists and in that moment everything becomes frightening, enraging and unbearably real. It does not sensationalise tragedy and it does not treat terror like entertainment. It confronts you with history and demands that you feel something instead of just consuming it.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is special because it is not scared to show the truth even when the truth is ugly.<br/><br/>Oh man, I could go on and on about how I am in absolute awe but anything I say right now will probably sound like hyperbole to y&#39;all, so it is better that you go watch the film and live the experience I just lived.<br/><br/>The post credit scene that teases Dhurandhar 2 gave me chills.<br/><br/>19 March 2026. I&#39;ll be there.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t know if these words do justice to what I just experienced, but if you&#39;re reading this -<br/><br/>Go watch Dhurandhar. Not later. Now.",53,
rw11006061,kspvg,,Aditya Dhar !! You beauty,"What a movie !!!! Shows how actually a spy operates.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It is not merely a spy thriller; it is an emotional reminder of the men and women who walk unknown streets, carry hidden identities, and fight unacknowledged battles so that the rest of us can live in peace. Rarely does a film manage to blend intensity, patriotism, and raw human emotion with such precision.<br/><br/>The narrative hits with force. Every frame feels purposeful, every scene carries weight. The director crafts a world of shadows where loyalty is tested, sacrifice is constant, and courage is not loud - it is silent, disciplined, and deeply personal. What touches the heart is the film&#39;s honesty. It does not glorify heroism; it reveals the emotional cost behind it.<br/><br/>The lead actor delivers a performance that is both powerful and heartbreakingly vulnerable. You see the steadiness of a soldier, the burden of duty, and the quiet tremors of a human being who cannot afford to break. The supporting cast mirrors this emotional depth, giving the story a lived-in realism that draws you in completely.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp yet sensitive, capturing the spirit of service without theatrics. The background score elevates this emotional journey beautifully - stirring, soft at the right moments, and rising with a patriotic pulse when needed. The cinematography matches the tone perfectly, pulling you into the tension, the loneliness, and the unspoken bravery that defines an intelligence operative&#39;s life.<br/><br/>What makes Dhurandhar unforgettable is its heart. It honours those who protect India without applause, without visibility, without rest. It is a tribute to sacrifice that ordinary people will never fully understand - and that is exactly why it must be seen.<br/><br/>A gripping, emotional, deeply heartfelt film.",32,

rw11001505,kulincoolkkp,,"Dhurandhar: A Bold, Immersive Thriller Elevated by Powerful Performances and Technical Mastery","Dhurandhar opens with striking intensity, pulling the audience straight into the unforgiving world of covert operations and the psychological weight carried by those who live behind enemy lines. Rumoured to be inspired by the life of Major Mohit Sharma, the film blends tension, atmosphere, and high-stakes drama with impressive control. Ranveer Singh delivers a steady, compelling performance, while Akshaye Khanna&#39;s near-silent portrayal of Rehman Dakait is magnetic-every look feels loaded with meaning. Technically, the film is exceptional: the score heightens the suspense, the cinematography and production design achieve an eerie authenticity, and the VFX integrates seamlessly with practical work. Smart use of real footage and audio elevates key moments into genuinely chilling territory, and the action sequences are raw, grounded, and executed with remarkable precision.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandhar stumbles slightly is in its narrative density. With a large cast and multiple threads, the emotional core doesn&#39;t always receive the breathing room it deserves, and a few subplots-particularly the romantic track-feel less essential to the film&#39;s overall impact. A handful of violent moments edge toward excess, and the pacing occasionally stretches under the weight of its ambitions. Still, the film&#39;s strengths far outweigh its flaws. Dhurandhar stands as a bold, immersive, and technically outstanding thriller-one that leaves a strong impression and sets the stage confidently for its next chapter.",49,
rw11011701,kunalmshah,,So...it's good...but...,"Let&#39;s talk about the positives first. Great acting all around, very well cast. I think this was one of Rakesh bedi&#39;s best performances. I don&#39;t get the hype around Akshaye Khanna in this movie. He is always stellar and did well in this movie but this is no where close to his best acting performance. I felt his performance was as good as Sanjay dutt or Arjun Rampal without being that much better. Ranveer definitely stood out and carried the movie well. I&#39;m not a huge ranveer fan but he always performs really well. This was ranveer&#39;s &quot;Animal&quot;. The story line was compelling especially considering it was based on true events. The movie was very long though and did drag in certain parts. I also don&#39;t get the need for hard core gore when it comes to showing the violence. I thought they could&#39;ve done a better job of speaking more Urdu and less Hindi throughout the film to add to the authenticity of being in Pakistan. The music was average. Not a huge fan of the underlying Hindu nationalist subtext throughout the movie. This is not a movie I would want to watch again. That being said, I will be seeing the sequel for sure. I do feel it is way better than any yash raj spy universe movie but doesn&#39;t compare to movies like raazi and URI which shine in this &quot;spy/armed forces jai hind&quot; genre. Overall I would say this movie was towards the upper end of average but not above average in any metric.",14,
rw11046375,abbydash,,Not worth the hype,"Dhurandhar arrives wrapped in loud promotions and sky-high expectations, but sadly, the film struggles to live up to the buzz. What promises to be a gripping, high-energy entertainer ends up feeling oddly hollow and uneven. The background score and cinematography are serviceable, but they feel more like noise and visual gloss than meaningful storytelling tools. Even the action sequences, which were heavily marketed, lack originality and fail to leave a lasting impression.",7,

It is intense, gripping, emotional, and crafted on a massive scale. What stands out most is the powerhouse performance by Ranveer Singh, who disappears completely into the character. His raw intensity, vulnerability, and unpredictable energy make the film unforgettable.",16,
rw11006000,abhisheksingh-72561,,GAME CHANGER!!,"Aditya Dhar&#39;s Dhurandhar is a long, intense, and ambitious film that has earned strong but divided reactions from both critics and audiences.<br/><br/>A Gritty, Geopolitical Thriller<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of real historical events like the 1999 hijacking and the 2001 Parliament attack, the story follows a RAW agent who goes deep undercover into Karachi&#39;s Lyari underworld to dismantle a gangster-ISI terror nexus. The film is structured into distinct chapters and builds a gritty, complex world of espionage and geopolitical maneuvering.<br/><br/>The Major Strengths<br/><br/>· Powerhouse Performances: The cast is consistently praised as a major highlight. Ranveer Singh delivers a controlled, intense performance, often described as career-best. Akshaye Khanna is frequently called the scene-stealer, bringing a chilling, charismatic menace to his role.<br/><br/>· Technical Craftsmanship: The film is noted for its high production values, visceral action choreography, and a pulsating background score that significantly elevates the tension.<br/><br/>· Immersive World-Building: Director Aditya Dhar is commended for creating a detailed, believable, and ruthless world of Karachi&#39;s underworld and intelligence operations.<br/><br/>Key Points of Criticism<br/><br/>· Demanding Runtime: This is the film&#39;s most debated aspect. With a runtime between 212 to 214 minutes (over 3.5 hours), many reviews note that the narrative feels overstretched, particularly in the first half.<br/><br/>· Uneven Pacing: The slow-burn, deliberate pace of the first hour, dedicated to character and plot setup, tests the patience of some viewers expecting a faster thriller.<br/><br/>· Contested Romantic Subplot: The romantic track between Ranveer Singh&#39;s character and the politician&#39;s daughter (played by Sara Arjun) is seen by some critics as an underwritten element that could have been trimmed.<br/><br/>Final Verdict &amp; Audience<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is not a light, breezy watch. It is a dense, serious-minded spy saga that requires and rewards patience. Most reviews conclude that if you can commit to its epic length and appreciate grounded, performance-driven geopolitical thrillers, it offers a compelling big-screen experience.<br/><br/>However, if you prefer fast-paced, straightforward action or have limited tolerance for very long films, you might find it challenging. The film also ends with a clear setup for a sequel.<br/><br/>I hope this non-spoiler review helps you decide. Are you generally a fan of long-form, detailed storytelling in films, or do you tend to prefer tighter narratives? Knowing this could help me provide more tailored insights.",20,

He stole the show with his performance. A small but much needed human, comic relief came from him. As for the deeper insight into the politics of the two nations. It is lost in all the unnecessary violence. On a serious note, topics of national security, real threats to our country, need for more, more &amp; much, much more were touched upon in graphic details.

rw11026049,HasanQ-71,,Nothing really made sense,"Dhurandhar mistakes length, noise, and seriousness for intelligence. What it actually delivers is a convoluted spy drama that collapses the moment you stop admiring the background score and ask the most basic question: what was the mission?<br/><br/>The film opens with a hijacking by Jaish, after which Indian intelligence decides the best response is to send a criminal-turned-agent to Karachi to infiltrate a Lyari gang that has nothing to do with Jaish, terrorism, or the hijacking. Why Karachi? Why Lyari? Why this gang? The movie never bothers to explain.<br/><br/>From here, the agent inexplicably helps Rehman Dakait rise in the underworld. This rise then attracts two conveniently placed intermediaries who introduce Rehman to the ISI chief, a chain of events so dependent on blind luck that it accidentally turns espionage into a lottery. Neither the agent, Rehman, nor R&amp;AW plans this. It just... happens. Twice.<br/><br/>Ironically, terrorism only escalates because of the agent&#39;s involvement. Rehman starts supplying weapons to the ISI after the agent embeds himself in the gang. If the goal was to prevent attacks on India, the mission is not just a failure it is actively counterproductive.<br/><br/>At one point, the agent declares his ambition to become the &quot;King of Karachi,&quot; a line that sounds dramatic but leads absolutely nowhere. He neither becomes king, nor dismantles any terror network, nor prevents any attack. Instead, the plot gets distracted by a half-baked romance and ends with the agent assassinating the very man he helped empower.<br/><br/>The film then abruptly ends, as if it suddenly remembered it had been running for over three hours and needed to stop.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar wants to be gritty, intelligent, and epic. It is actually a bloated, poorly thought-out narrative where cause and effect don&#39;t exist, stakes are retroactively invented, and the protagonist&#39;s mission remains unclear even in the final act.<br/><br/>This isn&#39;t slow-burn storytelling.<br/><br/>This isn&#39;t complex espionage.<br/><br/>This is just noise masquerading as depth.<br/><br/>If you remove the performances, the score, and the scale, you&#39;re left with a spy thriller where the spy shouldn&#39;t have been sent in the first place and where the story only works if you don&#39;t think about it at all.",6,

They have not shown full potential of Ranveer in this part but i know he will explode in the next one and it&#39;s a request to bollywood don&#39;t forget to give work to Shashwat Sachdev this guy can do what Anirudh is doing in south exceptional soundtrack by him.,2,
rw11074163,shriram-karpur,,A Shallow Attempt at Patriotism That Misses the Mark,"While Indian cinema has recently seen a surge in high-quality, impactful patriotic films, every successful trend eventually produces imitators. This latest release is a prime example of a film attempting to capitalize on the &quot;patriotic mindset&quot; of the audience without putting in the necessary work on script, logic, or direction.<br/><br/>The Plot: Familiar Territory
The core premise is one we&#39;ve seen before: internal power struggles between rival Pakistani gangs serving as a front for the ISI. The narrative suggests that the Pakistani government uses these criminal skirmishes as a &quot;deniable&quot; way to funnel arms and ammunition into India to fuel terrorism. While the geo-political concept had potential, the execution turns it into a messy, confusing gang war rather than a taut political thriller.<br/><br/>The &quot;Faltu&quot; Factor
The film fails significantly in three major areas:<br/><br/>Dialogue Writing: The lines are uninspired and &quot;faltu,&quot; lacking the gravitas or sharp wit found in the modern classics it tries to emulate.<br/><br/>The Music: The songs feel forced, breaking the momentum of a story that was already struggling to stay afloat.<br/><br/>The Action: This is perhaps the film&#39;s greatest sin. In an era where audiences appreciate the grounded realism of movies like Sam Bahadur, this film opts for ridiculous, gravity-defying stunts that feel decades out of date.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: Save Your Head
The biggest disappointment lies in the final act. After a build-up of &quot;hoo-haa&quot; and hype, the movie culminates in a 25-minute fight sequence that is so unrealistic and loud it becomes physically draining. It lacks the emotional weight of Bajirao Mastani or the raw honesty of The Kerala Story.<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you decide to watch this for the plot, do yourself a favor and turn it off for the last 25 minutes. You&#39;ll save yourself a headache and some valuable time. Compared to the high-quality patriotic films of recent years, this one is a hollow imitation that prioritizes noise over nuance.",8,
rw11006847,ankitqu,,Emotional Depth with electrifying Action,"This is a film that thrives on contrasts-quiet moments of introspection juxtaposed with explosive action and high-stakes tension. Ranveer Singh anchors the story with a performance that is raw yet calculated, capturing the inner turmoil of a man caught between duty and conscience. Direction ensures every subplot has purpose, while editing keeps the long runtime compelling. The supporting cast provides depth and complexity, enhancing the narrative&#39;s stakes. Cinematic techniques-from handheld camera work to sweeping aerial shots-immerse viewers in both the underworld and the emotional landscapes.

The supporting cast adds layers to the narrative, each scene enriched by their nuanced portrayals. Director Dhar weaves together action, suspense, and political undertones seamlessly, creating a cinematic rhythm that never falters. The action sequences are meticulously choreographed, combining adrenaline-pumping fights with strategic tension, while the cinematography captures both the grit and grandeur of the setting. The editing maintains perfect pace, ensuring that even the quieter, character-driven moments hold immense weight. The film&#39;s score complements the visuals masterfully, heightening suspense without overwhelming the story.

Arjun Rampal&#39;s controlled menace creates tension that persists throughout, while Sara Arjun&#39;s emotional authenticity raises stakes. Aditya Dhar orchestrates narrative threads and action sequences with precision. Cinematography captures both the chaotic underworld and intimate character moments.

rw11033531,RyderAviCR7,,M Aditya Dhar Did What Bollywood Was Too Afraid To Do,"This movie is what happens when a director actually has the spine to tell the truth instead of playing it safe for multiplex audiences and foreign markets.<br/><br/>Dhurandar doesn&#39;t apologize. It doesn&#39;t soften the edges. It shows you exactly what happens when a spy operates in the shadows - the guilt, the isolation, the impossible choices. Aditya Dhar built this film on real incidents, real audio recordings, real photographs. That&#39;s not cinematic liberty - that&#39;s documentation dressed as cinema.<br/><br/>The violence? Absolutely necessary. People cry about &quot;graphic scenes,&quot; but it&#39;s literally nothing - a car accident on the road is more brutal than 80% of what&#39;s shown here. That&#39;s barely 3-4% of what actually happens in real life. The brutality in this film has purpose - it&#39;s reflective, not mindless. It&#39;s there to shake people up, not glorify gore.<br/><br/>And here&#39;s the uncomfortable truth: people want to cry &quot;too graphic&quot; because they&#39;ve been fed sugar their whole lives by Bollywood directors too afraid to upset Pakistan or their own conscience. This is a spy movie. Spies don&#39;t solve problems with dialogue and philosophy - they solve them with action, and sometimes that action is ugly. That&#39;s the reality. If you can&#39;t handle that, you&#39;re simply not mature enough for this film, and that&#39;s fine - no one&#39;s forcing you to watch. Go watch Kapil Sharma if you just want a laugh. This film is for those who have the spine to face reality.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>What killed me about this movie is how human it is. The lead doesn&#39;t become invincible. He doesn&#39;t single-handedly destroy an entire system while cracking jokes. He suffers. He carries the weight. He waits. He makes calculated moves. That&#39;s the actual craft of espionage, and no Bollywood film has ever shown it this way.<br/><br/>The performances are something else entirely. Every actor understands the assignment - this isn&#39;t about being likeable. It&#39;s about being real. You can feel the exhaustion, the purpose, the cost. That&#39;s masterclass acting right there.<br/><br/>And here&#39;s the thing people won&#39;t say out loud - this film is necessary. Not because it&#39;s anti-Pakistan or pro-India propaganda. It&#39;s necessary because it shows our young generation that there ARE people willing to bleed for this country, and their stories deserve to be told without apology or filter. That&#39;s not nationalism - that&#39;s truth.<br/><br/>YRF and the &quot;progressive&quot; brigade will never make this film. They&#39;re too busy worrying about what Twitter thinks and whether their next release will play in Gulf markets. Aditya Dhar didn&#39;t care about any of that. He made a film for Indians, about Indians, showing the reality of what Indians face.<br/><br/>This is the most honest spy film Indian cinema has ever produced. Period.<br/><br/>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Raw. Uncompromising. Absolutely necessary.",3,
rw11031447,abhinabapal,,"Dhurandhar is not just a movie, it's a hard slap of truth.","It hits hard because it doesn&#39;t rely on &quot;cinematic exaggeration.&quot; Instead, it builds its story on real incidents - from the Kandahar hijack, to the 2001 Parliament attack, the fake currency network, and even the Lyari gang war links to 26/11.<br/><br/>What makes it truly intense is the use of real footage, real images, and real audio of terrorists, that detail alone changes the whole experience. You don&#39;t just watch the film, you feel the weight of what actually happened.<br/><br/>If you want a thriller that&#39;s not just entertaining but also shocking, informative, and unforgettable.

rw11013002,omkarjoshi1989,,Perfect example of how covert spy movie should be made,"Director is the character of the movie. With Uri as his first directorial movie, he gave what NEW BHARAT represents, jo dushman ke ghar me ghusta bhi hai aur marata bhi hai.<br/><br/>Some original and some originally inspired government officials characters makes it realistic. Covert spy doesn&#39;t provided all setup , all spoon feed mission intel on land, otherwise this time the wait is longer and spy has to make his way up in gangsters of Lyari town of Pakistan. Infaltrating enemy within is the motto here. Its not usual bollywood-ish spy thriller with high octane one sided action scenes, and heroine in bikini sequences. Here we get to see 3 hours and 32 minutes long saga of a man conspiring on his each step with calm mind and clear intentions to reveal enemy plans informing back to India.<br/><br/>Special mention for Akshay Khanna as villain manages to hit the impact on viewers even if hes not the hero of the film. Ranveercs character Hamza Ali Mazari, takes back foot in screenplay which feels correct since he has to implement his mission in most intelligent manner.<br/><br/>R Madhavan as Ajit Doval&#39;s inspired character Ajay Sanyal impacts you whenever he&#39;s on screen. Rage inside his eyes during annopening scene when he&#39;s been mocked by terrorist on plane, was top notch. With Mission Dhurandhar, he is in fact going to show enemy that &quot;Indians ke gude me kitna jor hai&quot;<br/><br/>Movie at one point shows 26/11 incidents first hand by using RED ACREEN EFFECT, which I don&#39;t think been implemented so great in any of the past films.<br/><br/>Kudos to Jio Studios and Director Ditya Dhar and all casting for giving such a wonderful wonderful film to root for!",5,

rw11017034,chand-suhas,,"Ghayal hun, isiliye Ghatak hun!","Narrated in 10 chapters, Aditya Dhar&#39;s highly ambitious magnum opus is that rare espionage thriller that enjoys proper research, aided by superb casting. The Director&#39;s confidence in his narrative, can be seen in the nearly 2 hours long first half with both halves getting 5 chapters each for a period of 10 years. Hamza infiltrates Pakistan&#39;s notorious gang run by Rehman Dacait and rises through the rank as his confidante. The way he gathers the information about how ISI uses these gangsters for their weapons is quite intriguing. The extreme violence is in sync with the current demand and I wasn&#39;t bothered by it. Despite the lengthy runtime, the film remains engaging though exhausting. The second half does get predictable and doesn&#39;t match the first half.<br/><br/>Ofcourse the other need of the hour, the whole politics of it is what leaves a bitter taste considering the original story was potent enough and the good performances carried the story forward. The jingoistic nationalism with Pakistan as the target was pretty much given and that is definitely not the issue. Yet, the opening disclaimer reads out loud and clear, that the film is inspired by true events and that it doesn&#39;t intentionally target anybody. When they resort to present this as the reality with the usage of actual terror attacks footage and call transcripts, it gets tougher to accept the politics behind this. Sure, the attempt is to trigger the strong emotional response which again was possible without over doing it. The film would have remained impactful even without the political appeasement it resorts to doing, not so subtly.",6,

The love story
Editing feels choppy in action sequences.<br/><br/>Sound design - Sometimes, the sound of a gun firing doesnt match with the shots being fired(especially in the 2nd half)
(MINOR SPOILER AHEAD)
The ending chase sequence between SP aslam, Hamza, and Rehman dacait feels a little too &quot;Bollywoodised&quot; and doesn&#39;t match the vibe with the rest of the picture(tho it&#39;s not that big of an issue).",5,

Every thread gets tied up and nothing feels forced. The tension just keeps climbing and the background music always keeps you engaged.<br/><br/>What really got me was how real everything felt. Real events are seamlessly made a part of the movie. It genuinely feels like you are inside the movie where one wrong move could end up in a catastrophic disaster for the titular characters. Each character got ample screen time to establish themselves in the movie.

In fact, the scenes couldn&#39;t have been executed any better-there is truly zero room for improvement in terms of visual storytelling and narrative flow.<br/><br/>One of the film&#39;s strongest assets is its casting. All the actors, including those in supporting and side roles, are perfectly chosen and deliver performances that feel natural and convincing. Each character adds value to the plot rather than simply filling space. The leads maintain a strong screen presence, but what makes Dhurandhar feel so complete is how well the ensemble complements them. Their chemistry and timing elevate the film to a whole new level.<br/><br/>The use of music deserves special appreciation, particularly the placement of the title track.

rw11049396,preetishenterprises,,"""Not All Roles Need Loud Dialogues""","Subtle acting works best in espionage dramas, and Ranveer Singh clearly understands that restraint extremely well. His performance is rooted in control rather than exaggeration, which suits the genre perfectly. Espionage is not about constant loud dialogues or dramatic outbursts; it is about silence, observation, internal conflict, and calculated decisions. Ranveer sticks to this realism and plays his character with discipline, allowing the audience to read what is happening beneath the surface rather than spelling everything out.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna adds solid depth and balance to the film. His presence strengthens the narrative and complements the lead performance effectively. The chemistry between the two feels organic, and their performances help maintain the serious, grounded tone the story aims for. Instead of competing for attention, both actors serve the film&#39;s intent, which is refreshing to see.<br/><br/>The problem lies not in the performances but in how modern audiences often judge cinema. Many online reviews seem to equate good acting with loud dialogues, aggressive expressions, or &quot;mass&quot; moments. Espionage films demand patience and attentiveness, as much of the tension exists internally rather than on the surface. When viewers approach such films expecting instant gratification, they risk missing the subtle layers that make the genre effective.<br/><br/>Online audiences, especially younger reviewers influenced by social-media hype, would benefit from watching such films with more observation and less overreaction. Not every role needs to shout to leave an impact. Quiet, restrained performances often require more skill and understanding of character.<br/><br/>Overall, this film deserves appreciation for attempting realism and for performances that respect the genre. It may not cater to everyone&#39;s expectations, but for viewers willing to engage thoughtfully, it offers a controlled and sincere cinematic experience.",2,

rw11038973,Wilot,,"A Relentless, Intellectual Bloodbath","If Uri was a surgical strike, Dhurandhar is an all-out siege. Spanning a massive 214 minutes, it avoids the &quot;3-hour slump&quot; by shifting its weight between visceral, R-rated action and a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; plot that demands your constant attention. It is a rare action film that treats its audience as chess players rather than just spectators.<br/><br/>Action: Grounded, Brutal, and Kinetic
Unlike the floaty, digital spectacle of modern blockbusters, the action here feels dangerously heavy.<br/><br/>The &quot;Splatter&quot; Realism: From motorcycle chases through narrow Karachi alleys to the &quot;meat-hook&quot; sequences, the violence is unflinching. It doesn&#39;t rely on slow-motion &quot;hero moments&quot;; instead, the choreography emphasizes the raw desperation of a spy fighting to survive deep undercover.<br/><br/>Sound as a Weapon: The background score by Shashwat Sachdev-blending Arabic hip-hop with metallic, industrial beats-turns every shootout into a sensory assault that keeps the adrenaline levels high for the entire runtime.<br/><br/>The Plot: A Labyrinth of Betrayal
The &quot;good plot twists&quot; you mentioned are the film&#39;s true engine. Rather than a simple good-vs-evil story, Dhurandhar plays with nested identities:<br/><br/>The Long Game: Ranveer Singh&#39;s Hamza Ali Mazari isn&#39;t just a spy; he is a man playing a role within a role. The script keeps you guessing whether he has genuinely been &quot;turned&quot; by the brotherhood of Akshaye Khanna&#39;s charismatic Rehman Dakait.<br/><br/>The Moral Grey: The biggest twist isn&#39;t a &quot;whodunnit&quot; but a &quot;who-am-I.&quot; The film brilliantly dismantles the bond between the hero and the villain, showing how nationalism can lead to a betrayal that feels as cold as it is necessary.<br/><br/>Standing Out in the Genre
While many spy films (like the YRF Spy Universe) opt for &quot;Barbieland&quot; glamour, Dhurandhar feels lived-in. Akshaye Khanna&#39;s performance as the calculating mobster is a masterclass in quiet menace, often stealing the screen from the more restrained Ranveer Singh. It&#39;s the interplay between these two-and the shocking &quot;Part 1&quot; cliffhanger-that makes the length feel earned.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Dhurandhar is a &quot;quantum leap&quot; for Indian action cinema. It&#39;s long, it&#39;s loud, and it&#39;s unapologetically violent, but it has the brains to match its brawn.",2,

He is very talented and underutilized actor in Bollywood.

Ranveer Singh&#39;s performance is electric, balancing ferocity with quiet introspection, while the director&#39;s commitment to detail ensures the narrative never loses focus. The action sequences are grounded yet thrilling, blending realistic choreography with cinematic flair. Secondary characters, each distinct and purposeful, add depth to the storyline. Cinematography captures both the grandeur of cityscapes and the claustrophobic tension of alleyways and hideouts. The editing masterfully maintains suspense, gradually building toward an explosive second half.

The screenplay, co-written with the director, weaves real archival footage with visceral recreations, blurring lines between fact and fiction in spine-chilling sequences-like a red-tinted assault where haunting audio of victims&#39; voices pierces the silence. Action set pieces are choreographed with brutal realism: no glossy CGI excesses, just bone-crunching hand-to-hand combats and sniper duels that leave you breathless. It&#39;s a film that prioritizes &quot;we will enter your home to kill&quot; over subtle and useless diplomacy. Ranveer Singh is subtle and layered...easily his best performance...Akshaye Khanna is charming and ruthless at the same time...Arjun Rampal looks like a demon...Madhvan looks uncanny like Ajit Doval...Rakesh Bedi is great in the role of a cunning politician...Sanjay Dutt is Sanjay dutt on screen which suits his character...Sara Arjun also plays her role pretty well...Danish Pandor, Saumya Tandon and actors playing khanani brothers are good too..",5,

rw11007794,mayankprakash1979,,"Part 1: Fiction, But Grounded - And Very Watchable","Is the 3 hour 40 minute runtime justified for just Part 1 of a spy thriller? The real answer will only come with Part 2 - but one thing is clear: the film remains consistently engaging. I&#39;ve enjoyed many 3-hour-plus films in the past, so the length wasn&#39;t an issue for me. The pacing is taut, and the violence is relentless but not without dramatic purpose. Most of the lead actors fully commit, and that effort shows.<br/><br/>The film is divided into chapters, but this choice adds little value. The narrative flows linearly, characters overlap across sections, and the chapter breaks feel more cosmetic than structural.<br/><br/>Is it propaganda? Yes and no - and it depends on one&#39;s lens. The film is a highly fictionalized account that draws from multiple covert operations and real geopolitical situations: the Baloch struggle, Lyari&#39;s underworld, and ISI-backed militancy. Madhavan&#39;s character, clearly modeled on Ajit Doval, does push the familiar narrative of a weak UPA vs a strong NDA - just as Uri and Article 370 did - but it never derails the storytelling. This is a well-crafted film first, with strong direction and technical finesse.<br/><br/>Performances are uniformly solid. Ranveer Singh is excellent when he plays it grounded - and though he stays mostly in the background here, his presence is central. Akshaye Khanna shines (as he always does), reminding us of his incredible range and how underutilized he has been over the past two decades. The biggest surprise is Rakesh Bedi, who balances humour and cunning beautifully and holds his own among heavyweights.<br/><br/>The only disappointment in the cast is Sanjay Dutt. He seems disinterested, and his scenes feel flat - though capable direction and stronger co-actors keep them afloat.<br/><br/>The music choices elevate several sequences, though the wedding &quot;item&quot; number could have been replaced with a slick retro track. The action is intense and impactful, but almost every gunfight is marred by excessive shaky-cam, which dilutes clarity and tension. And the final hand-to-hand combat sequence goes on far too long - clunky, old-school choreography that doesn&#39;t match the sophistication seen earlier. Interestingly, a much shorter revenge set-piece earlier in the film packs a far bigger punch.<br/><br/>The ending provides closure while leaving us truly curious about Ranveer&#39;s past and his next move.<br/><br/>Part 2 arrives in March - and I&#39;m all in for it.",9,

Clocking in at a massive 3 hours and 34 minutes, it is an epic that demands patience but rewards it with some of the best technical craft and acting seen in recent years.<br/><br/>Film is monumental achievement in Hindi cinema - a nearly 4-hour epic that feels gripping from start to finish without a single dull moment. Ranveer Singh embodies Hamza, the undercover Indian agent infiltrating Karachi&#39;s deadly underworld to dismantle the ISI-terror nexus, with remarkable restraint and depth. But the real standout is Akshaye Khanna as the charismatic yet ruthless gangster Rehman Dakait - his swag, menacing presence, and razor-sharp dialogue delivery make him the undisputed MVP.<br/><br/>Dhar masterfully weaves real historical events (IC-814 hijacking, Parliament attack, 26/11) into a fictional Godfather-style mafia saga set in Lyari&#39;s gang wars. The world-building is immersive, the cinematography stunning, and the intelligent scripting trusts the audience with complex moral ambiguities and high-stakes espionage.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a rare beast: a high-budget blockbuster with the soul of an indie thriller. It is a masterpiece of tension and a testament to Ranveer Singh&#39;s versatility.

rw11014135,Tan-298,,"A must watch, What a brilliance !!","The movie overall is an absolute brilliance, and the story overall is very well developed for the upcoming climax or plot. The film starts from an intriguing point which perfectly lines up on what will happen next in the story. The character portrayed by R. Madhvan in the Film (Ajay Doval irl ) is superb even though it doesn&#39;t have enough screen time. The main story which starts after the unfortunate events that happen. The story is developed very well, and I accept the story does develop slowly in the first half. However, they made sure that there are no holes in the movie which led to a smooth storyline to take place. We then see Akshaye Khanna&#39;s character, and everyone falls in love with his acting and especially the dance. Akshaye Khanna was very closely representing Raheem Baloch also when it came with the dialogue delivery. It felt I was the one facing him. Going to the next character which was portrayed by Arjun Rampal which received very less of screen time as he will be in the part 2 as a main villain (Theory). The character of Major Iqbal had no difference between the Reel and Real version. Next, we have SP Chaudhary Aslam acted by Sanjay Dutt was a gem and the casting for this role couldn&#39;t be offered to anyone else as Sanjay Dutt slayed in his role. Whenever he is on the screen the audience will feel a sense of laughter and this character added the life into the movie to lighten the mood from serious to a bit less serious. However, Aditya Dhar is a mastermind as he used red background followed by black text for that one particular scene released a feel of anger in my body for what the Pakistanis have done. Finally, Ranveer Singh&#39;s performance was very lively and engaging and it felt too real with all those emotions. The acting of Ranveer Singh was eventually foreshadowed by the eye-catching performance of Akshaye Khanna. The only thing that concerned me in the movie was some scenes which could have been a bit disturbing for some people to watch even if the movie is A rated.

Controlled, confident, and uncompromising in its seriousness, the film proves that scale and substance need not be mutually exclusive.<br/><br/>Dhar&#39;s direction is exemplary. He demonstrates absolute command over tone, pacing, and narrative intent, refusing to dilute complexity for easy gratification. The film thrives on measured tension, moral ambiguity, and disciplined storytelling, allowing characters - not spectacle - to drive the drama. Every frame feels purposeful, and the director&#39;s restraint becomes the film&#39;s greatest strength.<br/><br/>The background score and music are near-flawless in their execution. Used with precision, the music enhances atmosphere without overpowering the narrative. Silence is treated as a storytelling tool, and the score steps in only when necessary, elevating key moments with quiet authority.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Dhurandhar belongs unequivocally to Akshaye Khanna. In a career defined by understated excellence, this ranks among his finest work. Khanna delivers a performance of rare control - internal, intelligent, and deeply absorbing. With minimal dialogue and maximum impact, he commands the screen through sheer presence, making power feel lived-in rather than performed. His portrayal adds gravitas and credibility, anchoring the film&#39;s emotional and intellectual core.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh matches the film&#39;s intensity with a committed, finely tuned performance, but it is Khanna&#39;s restraint that leaves the deepest impression.

The film&#39;s biggest strength remains its cast. Ranveer Singh delivers a remarkably restrained performance, portraying an intelligence operative with quiet intensity instead of loud heroism. Akshaye Khanna&#39;s sharp, calculating presence adds intellectual weight, while Sanjay Dutt&#39;s rugged authority anchors the narrative. In supporting roles, R. Madhavan and Arjun Rampal elevate the stakes with layered, convincing portrayals.<br/><br/>The background score deserves special mention. Instead of relying on generic patriotic notes, it uses subtle percussive tension and atmospheric themes that heighten suspense during covert operations. The score never feels overbearing; it moves with the emotion of each scene and helps maintain a gripping tone.<br/><br/>The storyline and plot revolve around cross-border espionage, internal betrayal, and a mission that tests loyalty, fear, and sacrifice. Aditya Dhar keeps the plot lean and focused, allowing characters to breathe without slowing the pace too much. The writing avoids unnecessary melodrama and sticks to mission-driven realism, though a few mid-act turns feel predictable. The buildup to the climax is strong and sets a compelling foundation for Part 2.<br/><br/>Narration is crisp, with limited voiceovers that actually add depth instead of spoon-feeding. The film uses visual storytelling: silent glances, coded exchanges, and detailed operation sequences that make the world feel lived-in.<br/><br/>The editing is tight and purposeful. Action sequences are cut cleanly, without shaky-cam excess. The transitions between narrative threads are smooth, and the film maintains momentum for most of its runtime. The second act slows slightly, but the well-paced final stretch compensates.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the songs are minimal and placed thoughtfully. Instead of disrupting the pace, they serve as emotional anchors during transitional moments. No random item numbers, no unnecessary romance tracks; the soundtrack stays aligned with the film&#39;s tense tone.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a performance-driven, technically polished thriller that respects the viewer&#39;s intelligence.

rw11035434,senbalaram,,Good,"Movie was great absolutely no reasons are there for not liking the movie , but here comes a outrageous point where the movie feels like a very elongated movie which demands your full attention spam and many of the peoples lack that
Also the dance numbers are not so high but could have been avoided because u are making a movie on a spy not any avg bollywood movie where dance numbers are the main subject
Another point is my personal opinion i dont know its logical for the vast audience or not but the scenes of the actor with the actress is very exaggerated and very long it could have been easily trimmed and that could have added the next story of the movie in the same whole damn movie
So that&#39;s what i feel off about dhurandhar and it could have been a lot shorter but it delivered what its made for , pretty entertaining also

rw11029062,RhishikeshA,,"Dhurandhar - Intense, Stylised, Violent... but Not Quite As Good As Uri","Dhurandhar is a film that announces its intent very clearly... this is going to be intense, larger than life, and unapologetically violent. By Bollywood standards, it pushes the envelope on brutality, and that in itself makes it stand out.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar deserves credit for attempting to stitch together real world inspired events and characters, clearly drawing parallels to known personalities and incidents. The effort is visible, even if the execution doesn&#39;t always feel fully real.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh dominates the screen as a full blown alpha male. He looks dashing, aggressive, and physically overpowering... so much so that his built is too big for his clothes. His clothes were unable to contain the bulge of his muscular built.. :D
His presence is raw and commanding, and he fits perfectly into the alpha male protagonist&#39;s role!<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, however, is the real surprise. His portrayal carries a quiet but deeply unsettling violence. The smile, the posture, the controlled menace... everything is on point. His much discussed dance moves gaining traction on social media seem less about choreography and more about the aura of his character combined with the background score.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the female lead feels completely unnecessary. She adds neither narrative weight nor emotional depth. The film honestly didn&#39;t need a heroine at all, and her presence feels like a Bollywood necessity rather than a requirement of the story.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan&#39;s character strongly resembles Mr. Dobhal, but sadly, Madhavan doesn&#39;t get enough space to explore or elevate the role. It feels like a missed opportunity for an actor of his calibre. Arjun Rampal remains strictly average... no highs, no lows, just present. Sanjay Dutt, on the other hand, brings in a rugged, old school masculinity. Broad shouldered, raw, yet oddly classy... he proves once again that some actors genuinely age well.<br/><br/>A special mention goes to Rakesh Bedi, whose performance feels underrated. His Urdu lehza is authentic, his physicality matches the character, and he looks convincingly real in the role. He was excellent in Uri as well, and his consistency continues here.<br/><br/>That comparison with Uri is inevitable... and unfortunately for Dhurandhar, Uri was far more grounded, believable, and impactful. In comparison, Dhurandhar leans heavily into stylisation and violence, sometimes at the cost of realism.<br/><br/>Final verdict:
Dhurandhar is intense, ambitious, and visually aggressive. It doesn&#39;t quite reach the emotional or narrative strength of Uri, but it&#39;s still a solid one-time watch.. especially for those who enjoy gritty, masculine, high-voltage cinema.<br/><br/>Not flawless, not forgettable... but definitely not Dhar&#39;s best.",1,
rw11011623,TenzinW-40,,"Authentic, Gritty, and True","Dhurandhar genuinely surprised me-in the best way. As someone from the armed forces, I&#39;m usually very critical of how movies portray intelligence work, but this film felt real, grounded, and respectful of the profession. It didn&#39;t exaggerate the life of a spy with unnecessary glamour or over-the-top heroism. Instead, it captured the silent grit, the constant tension, and the unseen sacrifices that define real operatives.<br/><br/>The storyline is tight, the pacing sharp, and the character development subtle yet powerful. What impressed me most was how the film showed the emotional weight carried by those who work in the shadows-how every decision they make comes with consequences the world never hears about. The lead actor delivered a performance that felt authentic, restrained, and deeply human.<br/><br/>For me, Dhurandhar stands out because it offers respect to the intelligence community without turning them into caricatures.

Dhurandhar moves with such pace and intensity that it genuinely does not feel like a long movie. It is an excellent thriller anchored by great dialogues and massive screen presence from (most of) its cast.<br/><br/>The absolute highlight is Akshaye Khanna. I predicted this back when the trailers dropped, but the &quot;aura farming&quot; he achieves here is legendary. He cuts a menacing figure throughout the film and steals every scene he is in.<br/><br/>He is backed by strong performances from R. Madhavan, who brings incredible poise to the screen, and Arjun Rampal, whose sinister presence adds a layer of dread to the narrative.<br/><br/>What sets this apart from the standard Bollywood fare, however, is the treatment of the protagonist. It was a swift and welcome departure to see a hero allowed to be vulnerable. Moving away from the &quot;untouchable god&quot; trope made the stakes feel real.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Sanjay Dutt&#39;s SP Chaudhary was a let down. The character felt less capable than the setting demanded, and it felt like a missed opportunity. As for the leading lady, she was just okay, not hateable, but not memorable either.<br/><br/>The biggest technical flaw, however, is the action. It is painful to say, but it seems we Indians cannot choreograph a good gunfight if our lives depended on it. For a movie with such high stakes, the shootouts lacked the tactical grit and polish needed to be convincing.<br/><br/>The film stumbles hardest at the finish line. The story culminates in a chaotic scramble that felt like an absolute mess. It was rushed and missed a golden opportunity to deliver a truly diabolical, dark ending that the tone of the movie deserved.<br/><br/>However, the movie saves face in the dying moments.

However, as the film progresses, the storytelling becomes uneven, with predictable turns and emotional beats that don&#39;t fully land.

Despite entering with high expectations, I was very disappointed by its repetitive violence and lack of meaningful storytelling. The violence, instead of deepening the narrative, felt cartoonish and excessive, serving only to glorify the protagonist&#39;s masculinity. The spy-thriller plot lacked real tension, as the main character never seemed truly in danger, making the story feel hollow. Action sequences, though heavily promoted, were clumsily choreographed and lacked creativity or realism. Ranveer Singh&#39;s lead role felt purposeless, existing mainly to serve that political agenda. A few positives were noted - mainly a strong opening and Akshaye Khanna&#39;s performance.

The character choices are spot-on, and every role feels deliberate and well-placed. Akshaye Khanna absolutely steals the show with his screen presence. Ranveer gives a stunning performance as well - despite having very few dialogues, his reactions alone carry major portions of the narrative forward. All the supporting actors have delivered excellent work and elevate the intensity of the film.<br/><br/>The action sequences are staged brilliantly - raw, violent, and high-impact. However, they do feel like they&#39;re following the current trend in action cinema rather than offering something new. There&#39;s also a tiny bit of propaganda sprinkled into the narrative, and it&#39;s quite evident, which may not land well with everyone. The cinematography is stylish, and the chapter-based story staging adds a nice structural rhythm to the film.<br/><br/>Ranveer and Sara Arjun&#39;s chemistry feels a bit off - maybe because I&#39;ve seen her as a child actor, so imagining her opposite Ranveer felt slightly strange. The story itself leans heavily to one side, presenting a very singular perspective about India. The music is good, fits the tone, but isn&#39;t particularly memorable or groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a solid, engaging film that delivers on intensity and performance.

Finally 4 hours spent wisely. Having left my motherland 25 years ago, going to the cinema has always been a moment of contemplation for me, especially given the reputation Bollywood has carried over the years. But Dhurandar changed something within me and people around me..<br/><br/>This film gave me answers I&#39;ve been holding inside for decades. When demonetisation happened, many friends from Delhi kept rattling on with negativity, never acknowledging the deeper truth. Most of them, frankly, are businessmen dealing in black money and avoiding taxes, and yet they complained the loudest. This movie finally exposes the mindset and the networks that have been weakening the nation for nearly 50 years. Watching it felt like a personal relief, a sense of peace, because the truth was finally put on screen for all to see.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances.... hats off to Maddy and Akshay Khanna. They have delivered a true definition of art. Their portrayal has reignited in me the desire to return to the cinema and witness meaningful films on the big screen.<br/><br/>For context, the last movie I saw in a cinema was Vikram Vedha (in Tamil)... I didn&#39;t understand a single word, but still enjoyed every second of it. That&#39;s the power of good cinema.<br/><br/>It is my observation that India is transitioning into a new demographic i.e.- intelligent, aware, wise, and this film reflects that shift beautifully. Ranveer, despite being young and still early in his journey, has done a remarkable job. And Aditya Dhar.. whom I didn&#39;t even know before yesterday ... deserves all the credit for such powerful direction. If he ever reads this, I want to send him my blessings and heartfelt wishes for continued success.<br/><br/>Indian cinema is finally moving in a positive direction, destined to become one of the world&#39;s finest industries. And seeing self-made artists, especially from the South, getting their due recognition is truly a blessing.<br/><br/>Personally speaking, Dhurandar is more than a movie... it&#39;s an awakening.

Smart humour appears at the right moments, giving small breathers between heavy scenes. Overall, it&#39;s a solid, engaging, and absolutely must-watch film.",3,
rw11001147,Ashiiish,,A Brutal And Unflinching War Drama That Loses Its Grip Along the Way,"Dhurandhar opens with a jolt. The film throws you straight into the brutality of its historical backdrop, staging the violence with a kind of cold intensity that doesn&#39;t let up. Rumoured to be inspired by the real life of Major Mohit Sharma, the story dives into the world of undercover operations, betrayal, and the constant tension of living behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>The performances are easily the strongest pillar here. Ranveer Singh handles the lead role with solid control, especially in the heavier moments, though the film never lets us truly get under his skin. The real standout is Akshaye Khanna as Rehman Dakait. He barely speaks, yet his eyes carry entire paragraphs. Every expression lands like a threat, and he steals the frame without even trying.<br/><br/>Technically, Dhurandhar is one of the most impressive Indian films in a while. The background score keeps tightening the rope around the audience, the cinematography and color palette create an eerie authenticity, and the VFX work blends so well with the practical shots that you barely notice the seams. Some of the chase scenes use a shaky camera style that actually heightens the panic. The set design is remarkable too. Even though they clearly couldn&#39;t shoot in the real locations, the recreation is so convincing you forget you&#39;re watching a constructed world.<br/><br/>There&#39;s a moment where real footage is folded into an action scene and another where the film cuts from the dramatization of the 26/11 handlers to the actual audio. Both scenes are chilling, and honestly the closest the film gets to brilliance. The action is brutal, grounded, and shockingly raw. Nothing is sugar-coated, and some moments push into gore unlike anything we&#39;ve really seen in mainstream Indian cinema. The makeup and costuming only make it feel more real.<br/><br/>But the film collapses under its own weight. There are too many characters, too many arcs, and too many threads fighting for attention. With the narrative jumping around so much, there&#39;s almost no emotional connection with the protagonist or his mission. It&#39;s hard to care whether he succeeds or fails when the film doesn&#39;t slow down enough to let us live with him.<br/><br/>The romance between Ranveer Singh and Sara Arjun is easily the weakest part. Both actors perform well individually, but together the chemistry feels awkward and completely mismatched. It pulls you out of the story every time they appear as a couple.<br/><br/>The violence, while impressive in execution, sometimes crosses into excess. There are moments that feel gruesome just for the sake of being gruesome, adding shock but not substance.<br/><br/>The pacing is another major issue. The film feels extremely long, stretched by subplots that don&#39;t really need to exist. By the time it announces a second part coming in March 2026, the ending doesn&#39;t spark the excitement it thinks it does. Instead of a cliffhanger, it feels more like a pause you weren&#39;t ready for.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is ambitious, technically outstanding, and filled with powerful performances, but it&#39;s weighed down by bloat and uneven emotional storytelling. It&#39;s a film you respect more than you love.",47,

Predictably, it fails at both.<br/><br/>There is nothing genuinely serious or sincere about this film. The marketing leans heavily on the presence of a real army man in the trailers, only to completely deceive the audience in the climax. What unfolds instead resembles a spoof-loud, hollow, and shockingly disrespectful.<br/><br/>The film offers no real credit to the actual hero whose story it pretends to tell.

The performances feel lived-in, disciplined, and powerful.<br/><br/>From its opening scene, the film pulls you into a world dense with atmosphere and tension. It delivers chills, emotional weight, and a sense of urgency that rarely lets up. The screenplay captures a wide spectrum of emotions experienced by everyday Indians, especially through its sharp dialogues and the haunting struggles of the unnamed gunmen at its core.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh shines in the emotionally heavy moments and handles the high-octane action with complete command. R. Madhavan is outstanding - one particular moment where he seemingly breaks the fourth wall is both audacious and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar&#39;s vision deserves special mention. As a writer-director, he demonstrates remarkable control over tone, pacing, and thematic depth. His storytelling is bold, cohesive, and unapologetically cinematic. Few filmmakers can balance realism, patriotism, and spectacle with such finesse, and Dhurandar cements Dhar as one of the most exciting voices in contemporary Indian cinema.<br/><br/>In the end, Dhurandar is not just a film - it is an experience crafted with conviction and artistry.<br/><br/>Jai Hind.",2,
rw11014123,wazeemhasan,,Sad reality of Bollywood,"Just watched Dhurandhar. Since the story is based on Lyari, a neighborhood in Karachi just a few kilometers from where I live, I was curious to see what version Bollywood would roll out about something we Karachiites actually witnessed during the 2008-09 era.<br/><br/>1. The repeated idea that whoever rules Lyari rules Karachi is absolutely wrong in the movie. They have no idea about the real political power game in Karachi during 2008-09. The Lyari gang war existed, but it was only one small part of a much bigger landscape. Lyari itself is only 0.17 percent of the entire city.<br/><br/>2. No one in Pakistan celebrated the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. That is an impression Bollywood keeps feeding its audience. The whole &quot;We will destroy India&quot; gimmick does not work in Pakistan. People do not buy it. Even political and religious parties tried selling it and failed. People here are simply not interested in that chooran.<br/><br/>3. Lyari gang war was an internal conflict between local gangs fighting for territory and resources, tied to local and provincial politics. Linking it to 26/11 is just ridiculous. There is not even surface-level evidence for such a claim. But since that kind of narrative works for an Indian audience, Bollywood packaged and sold it.<br/><br/>4. In the story, India supposedly had all the intel about 26/11 and it still happened. It actually portrays how weak and incompetent the security layers were. The way the attackers keep communicating so easily on phone devices is not possible without inside help. In their self-victimization kink, they forgot what they themselves showed on screen.<br/><br/>5. The Indian spy repeatedly saying &quot;Jisne Lyari pe hukumat ki, usne puray Karachi pe hukumat ki&quot; is the funniest part. Do some actual research and you will understand who ruled Karachi in that timeline and what kind of power he had. Next time, come to us. We will tell you better stories this city holds.<br/><br/>Summary:
This is just another anti-Pakistan movie strategically designed to emotionally trigger the Indian audience through 26/11 and remind them that the-then government (Congress) did nothing, while the current government (BJP) is portrayed as the savior. Two dialogues make this intent obvious. One where the Pakistani General sarcastically says, &quot;We were expecting some reaction from India but they did nothing.&quot; The second when the Indian minister says, &quot;Kabhi koi sarkar to aayegi jisko desh ki chinta hogi.&quot;",5,

A cold blooded Gangster drama unleashes the performance of every star in this film to the roof. But the script is too old pointing to clashes around the line of control. The film traces an old script of a spy winning his battles against criminal networks, shadowy operatives and personal demons - all framed around cross border tensions. The Arabic song that introduces Akshay Khanna in a new avatar scores fandom in a friendly fashion, while steer- rocketing his act to the roof.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt was given a heavy role but should have won a larger time on screen.

The storytelling is so good that by the time it ended, the whole theater actually wanted more. It doesn&#39;t drag; it builds.<br/><br/>People love to throw around the word &#39;propaganda&#39; whenever a movie shows India winning, but Dhurandhar just presents facts, not opinions. It&#39;s a true story, grounded in reality, not some &#39;distorted&#39; narrative. It doesn&#39;t manipulate you; it just shows you what actually happened, and that reality is gritty enough on its own.<br/><br/>And let&#39;s talk performances. Everyone did their job, but Akshaye Khanna was on a different level. He literally &#39;aura farmed&#39; the entire movie. Even next to Ranveer Singh, Akshaye stole every single scene he was in.

Ranveer Singh takes the reins of the protagonist confidently, oozing aura in every slow motion walk and piercing eyes. He is vigilant, charismatic, and knows to deftly manoeuvre his enemies while being in the shadows. He also brings a certain vulnerability into the character despite the intensity, and that keeps you engrossed. Ranveer Singh continues to explore new genres and is one of the most versatile actors we have in Bollywood today.<br/><br/>Gangster politics and mafia being the central theme, there is violence and gore galore. Enough has been said about Akshaye Khanna, but credit is where credit&#39;s due. He blends into the character of the savage Rehman Dakait seamlessly, while Arjun Rampal plays Major Iqbal who is out for blood and destruction with an eerie sense of calm.<br/><br/>The songs thankfully do not disrupt the narrative.<br/><br/>I wanted to see more of R Madhavan and Sanjay Dutt here.

rw11024931,nishajamvwal78,,Of Grit Gore & Glory : Dhurandhar !,"Dhurandhar<br/><br/>I walked out of Dhurandhar in a time capsule - I had been living inside another, darker, more dangerous universe for three and a half hours. Rarely does a film hold one so completely, with a pace so assured and muscular, that time ceases to exist. Dhurandhar does exactly that - it grips, tightens its hold, and refuses to let go.<br/><br/>And then came the surprise. The kind that cinema sometimes delivers: I have always been a self-confessed admirer of Akshaye Khanna - his intelligence, his restraint, his eloquent understatement. But nothing had prepared me for the fact that he would walk away with the film. Yes, the film stars Ranveer Singh - the headline name, the force of nature, reportedly paid a staggering fifty crores - while Akshaye Khanna was allegedly paid a small fraction of that. And yet, it is Akshaye who dominates the emotional and psychological landscape of Dhurandhar.<br/><br/>As Rehman Dakait, he is terrifyingly elegant - a royal Don, composed, watchful, lethal. There is a Don Corleone gravitas to his performance: measured silences, piercing eyes, and a menace that doesn&#39;t need volume. After Chhaava earlier this year, this performance cements Akshaye Khanna as arguably the most talked-about and celebrated actor of the moment. It&#39;s not loud acting - it&#39;s authoritative, cerebral, and devastating. No wonder the internet exploded with so much about him and even speculations about his love life .<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is nothing short of fearless and magnetic. With a formidable ensemble - Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, and Rakesh Bedi - Dhurandhar unfolds as a bold, immersive experience that pushes Bollywood into a braver, grittier, far more authentic zone. The title itself means stalwart, and the film lives up to that promise.<br/><br/>Structured in a chapter-wise, docu-newsy narrative style - borrowing the best from web series storytelling - the film explores across-the-border terrorism with intense research, precision, and nerve. ( journalist Aditya Raj Kaul served as Research Consultant drawing inspiration from real Indian intelligence operations and figures)
Each segment adds a new layer, a new tension, a fresh perspective. The storytelling is gripping because it is rooted in truth, analysis, and lived geopolitical realities.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh as Dhurandhar is dynamite - but not in his usual flamboyant style. As Hamza Ali Mazari he is controlled, coiled, silent. A deadly daredevil who bides his time, watches patiently, and strikes only when it matters to win the trust of Rehman Daikat (Akshaye Khanna) and his men. It&#39;s a restrained, internalised performance - and that restraint makes it powerful. You nearly dont recognise Ranveer Singh here!<br/><br/>What elevates Dhurandhar is its extraordinary authenticity. The production design and locations plunge you straight into the claustrophobic, dangerous lanes of Lyari, Karachi - you don&#39;t watch it, you walk through it. The dialogues land hard. The action choreography is raw and unvarnished. There is brutality here, yes - but it is honest brutality, exposing systemic flaws without apology or fear. The selective use of cult Bollywood songs only heightens tension and deepens emotional texture.<br/><br/>For once, Bollywood abandons glossy spies, oiled waxed sculpted bodies, and stylised swagger with floosie women dancing around - and instead embraces grit, fatigue, fear, blood, gore and moral ambiguity. The anxiety, anticipation, and suspense are constant companions.<br/><br/>This film is, at its core, a homage - to the countless Dhurandhars: the unnamed, unknown, unsung men and women who operate in shadows so that the rest of us in India sleep in peace.<br/><br/>Madhavan is pitch-perfect as (we suspect) Aditya Duval - intelligent and grounded. Sanjay Dutt is burly, commanding, menacing in a way only he can be. Arjun Rampal as Major Iqbal is chilling and gory and may arguably be the portrayal of one of the most dreaded terrorists, Illyas Kashmiri. But that is speciation. And Rakesh Bedi&#39;s return in a completely unexpected avatar as Jameel is one of the film&#39;s quiet triumphs. Even the romantic moments never distract - they only intensify the stakes.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar, take a bow. After Uri and Article 370, he once again proves that Indian cinema can match - and sometimes surpass - the intensity of post-9/11 Hollywood political and spy thrillers. The box-office numbers are obvious proof of how audiences have taken to this film : a film that shakes you. As I watched audiences shouted &#39;Bharat Mata Ki Jai&quot; in patriotic fervour that gave me goosebumps!<br/><br/>Inspired by real incidents and covert operations, Dhurandhar tracks the perilous journey of an undercover agent behind enemy lines with nerve, nuance, and conviction. Each moment is mesmerising. Each performance, sharply etched.<br/><br/>I&#39;m already waiting - impatiently - for Revenge: Part 2.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t entertain. It unsettles and shakes you to the core. It awakens. And it reminds us that courage is often silent - and always costly.<br/><br/>Nisha JamVwal.",2,
rw11039171,VivekShuklaShuklas,,Dhurandhar is not just a spy film. It is a lived experience.,"A true-event espionage story that does not entertain you from a safe distance, but drags you straight into its moral weight, its fear, and its brutal realism. This is cinema that sits heavy on the chest.<br/><br/>There is a moment during the terror attack scene in front of Humza where the body reacts before the mind does. The helplessness is suffocating. The chanting, the chaos, the paralysis of a man trained to act but forced to watch. It was unsettling enough to make the hands cold and the spine shiver. That is not drama. That is truth hitting without warning.<br/><br/>What makes Dhurandhar a magnet, something you cannot pull yourself away from, is its cinematic confidence. The world feels lived-in, not designed. Lyari is not shown as a backdrop but as a breathing organism. Politics shifts like quicksand. Loyalties bend. Power changes hands silently. Every frame feels intentional. The camera does not shout. It observes.<br/><br/>This is where Aditya Dhar proves once again that he is operating on a different plane. His writing is sharp without being preachy. His direction trusts the audience to think. The craft here is world-class, full stop.<br/><br/>Rehman Dakait&#39;s portrayal has already received the praise it deserves, and rightly so. There is no need to add noise there. Some performances speak loudly by saying very little.<br/><br/>But the real surprise, the real anchor, is Ranveer Singh as Humza. This is not the loud, kinetic Ranveer Singh people expect. This is restrained, controlled, and frighteningly internal.<br/><br/>The scenes where he absorbs the planning of ISI and the gangs plotting against India are masterclasses in silent acting. You can see the calculations behind the eyes. Later, when he decides to become the king of Karachi and explains this choice to his girlfriend, the shift is seamless. No grand monologue. Just conviction. That scene alone proves how deeply he understood this character.<br/><br/>What the film captures perfectly is the contradiction of a spy. A man who thinks like a politician, operates like a criminal, loves like a human being, protects like a father, and still remains a patriot. Balancing all those identities without turning caricature is incredibly difficult. This film nails it.<br/><br/>The runtime is nearly three and a half hours, yet when the credits roll, the instinct is not to stand up. It is to sit. To breathe. Three and a half hours pass like twenty minutes. That is the ultimate compliment to storytelling.<br/><br/>Box office numbers will do whatever they do. That is noise. What matters is this: this film is not leaving theatres anytime soon. It will hold its ground until the next release on 19th March, because word of mouth like this cannot be bought.<br/><br/>To the entire cast, crew, production team, and especially to Aditya Dhar: thank you for raising the bar and quietly changing the face of Bollywood. Take a bow. And please, do not make us wait another six years after 19th March for the next one.<br/><br/>Lots of love &amp; Bharat Mata Ki Jay 🇮🇳",2,

At a time when OTT platforms dominate, Dhurandhaar has successfully pulled people back into theatres-and that itself is a big achievement.<br/><br/>The film has created its own unique identity. The inclusion of real footage and guided segments during the movie elevates it to a completely different level, making it feel more like an experience than just a film.<br/><br/>Talking about performances, the acting across the board is very strong. The film reinforces a powerful message-
no matter how much the truth is suppressed, it eventually finds its way out.<br/><br/>I would especially like to appreciate the side characters, who have delivered commendable performances and added depth to the story. Arjun Rampal&#39;s role is brief, but it leaves a lasting impact despite the limited screen time.<br/><br/>One small drawback is the chapter-based storytelling. While the concept works, the chapters feel slightly incomplete when they end, as they lack a proper closure, which leaves a sense of incompleteness.<br/><br/>🔹 Overall:

Great job Aditya and team!!<br/><br/>The entire ensemble is unbelievably strong, with every single character being extremely impactful. While there is-and rightly should be-more talk about Akshaye Khanna&#39;s brilliant performance, it was Ranveer Singh who blew my mind with his incredible calmness.

Amazing work by the entire cast.<br/><br/>A huge, massive shoutout to Shashwat Sachdev, the music director, because he is truly the soul of this movie! The blend of his score with the &quot;tadka&quot; of artists like Hanumankind and Arijit Singh has instantly become my new, long-term playlist. So many songs, and each one is better than the last.

⭐ Rating: 7/10<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a gritty, high-voltage action drama that dares to blend geopolitics, intelligence operations and raw emotion into one intense package. The story dives deep into RAW-ISI dynamics and India-Pakistan geopolitical tensions, giving the film a strong patriotic flavour that is bound to resonate with audiences in the coming days.<br/><br/>With a runtime of 3 hours and 30 minutes, the film is surprisingly engaging. Except for a few songs that momentarily break the momentum, the narrative remains gripping throughout. One of its major strengths is the chapter-wise storytelling, where each segment unfolds like a new episode-fresh, fast-paced and well-structured.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a classy, refined and deeply hard-worked performance. His intensity is magnetic from start to finish. But the scene-stealer is undoubtedly Akshaye Khanna as Rehman Daikat-sharp, fearless and brilliantly unpredictable.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt once again brings his iconic swagger, effortlessly owning his deadly-cop avatar. Arjun Rampal adds solid support with a decent and impactful presence.<br/><br/>A noteworthy addition is Sara Arjun, who performs with maturity and confidence, matching the expectations set for her role.<br/><br/>Technically, the film shines bright.<br/><br/>The cinematography is outstanding-realistic, immersive and visually grand. Many scenes look so authentic that it genuinely feels as if they were shot in Pakistan. The frames are raw, gritty and beautifully crafted, adding tremendous depth to the geo-political mood of the film.<br/><br/>Be cautioned: Dhurandhar is loaded with violence and frequent vulgar language, making it unsuitable for family viewing, especially for younger audiences.<br/><br/>Despite its intensity and rough edges, the film stands strong on patriotism, powerful performances and a bold narrative.

Madhavan) at the centre of the crisis-setting the tone for the film&#39;s tense, geopolitical canvas.<br/><br/>From there, the story dives into a high-stakes infiltration of Karachi&#39;s underworld. The first half tracks undercover operative Hamza Ali Mazari (Ranveer Singh) as he enters Lyari, building credibility from the ground up-often through brute violence, rapid-fire action, and nail-biting underworld escalations. Along the way, he&#39;s anchored by Mohammad Aalam (Gaurav Gera), a grounded presence amid the chaos.<br/><br/>The narrative also weaves in depictions of major terror incidents, including the 2001 Parliament attack and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, adding a heavy political and emotional charge to the first half.<br/><br/>The second half moves even faster, stitching together the political ecosystem and its deep links with the underworld. It highlights the power structures that run Karachi from the shadows-where influence, arms pipelines, and backroom alliances matter as much as street muscle. It also touches on the Balochistan angle and the region&#39;s simmering tensions, portraying violence and criminal rivalry as a grim, everyday reality.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoilers, the film ends on a sharp final turn involving Rehman Dakait (Akshaye Khanna) that decisively sets the stage for Part 2.<br/><br/>And yes-I tried hard to keep the &quot;spice&quot; in check while writing this review. Not easy at all!<br/><br/>Performances<br/><br/>The film boasts a terrific ensemble. Ranveer Singh as Hamza Ali Mazari delivers a remarkably controlled performance-measured, intense, and completely convincing.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, as Rehman Dakait, is tailor-made for the role-quiet menace, sharp presence, and perfectly calibrated intimidation.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan as Ajay Sanyal brings gravitas and moral weight to the narrative&#39;s big decisions.<br/><br/>Sara Arjun as Yalina Jamali looks stunning, commands the screen, and feels like a genuinely strong fit for the part.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt as S. P. Choudhary Aslam adds solid heft, and Arjun Rampal as Major Iqbal plays his part with authority.<br/><br/>Technical strengths<br/><br/>Technically, the film is top-class. Shashwat Sachdev&#39;s music is terrific, the background score lands cleanly, and the cinematography (Vikash Nowlakha) and editing (Shivkumar V. Panicker) are of a very high standard. The production design feels grounded and real-every department shows up.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar feels like a near-perfect blend of commercial cinema and a gripping thriller-songs, scale, and patriotism, while weaving in espionage and the complexities of Indo-Pakistan dynamics. I&#39;m genuinely eager for Dhurandhar: Part 2, slated for 19 March 2026.",1,

rw11031313,thedesicritic,,A Ranveer Singh blockbuster where Ranveer Singh is sidelined,"Overview
This was a star studded blockbuster in every sense of the word. Huge set pieces, gory violence, terrific performances, strong political messaging, and an exorbitant run time. A lot to unpack here so to make it easier:<br/><br/>The Good:
<ul><li>Phenomenal performances by the cast, more on that later.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Set design and attention to detail when creating Karachi was excellent. References and the look are very on point and added to the realism.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Storyline is very compelling.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Realistic action sequences. I have been calling out for this as in Hindi cinema action sequences are mostly idiotic and ridiculous with the protagonist usually turning into some sort of avenger. Dhurandhar keeps it as real as possible leading to effective sequences.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Bad:
<ul><li>No sense of nuance at all. The good Indian characters are always good. The bad Pakistani characters are always bad. There&#39;s no self-reflection on the part of the protagonist or questioning his own morality as he carries out the most shocking acts. Does not add much depth to the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Clunky political commentary. At times it resembles a documentary as Aditya Dhar hits the audience on the head with his views. At one point they even stop the entire movie to show audio of real terrorist interactions. This constantly takes the audience out of the film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Violence and gore. Was really good to a point, but again there is no restraint shown from the director, every scene had be extremely gory and in my opinion, they overdid it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ranveer Singh is the lead, but he basically has nothing to do. A couple of smart edits and this movie ends up being a good film on Pakistani gang wars. It&#39;s almost like there are two separate films going on and there was an awkward attempt to stitch them together.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, a good watch and I enjoyed the film, but it is not the greatest movie of all time that some commentary seems to be pushing, nor is it the worst movie as others imply. It is an entertaining watch but with a fair number of loopholes.<br/><br/>Plot
The film follows the protagonist, Hamza Ali Mazari (Ranveer Singh), an agent sent from India to infiltrate the Pakistani underworld based in the city of Karachi with the aim of passing information to India to stop terror related activities.<br/><br/>Acting
<ul><li>Ranveer Singh: What I thought was going to be a Ranveer Singh blockbuster ended up being a blockbuster without much of Ranveer Singh. He&#39;s a good actor and he did well in the role but was totally overshadowed by his co-stars. His own side quests were probably the least interesting parts of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Akshaye Khanna: Nothing more to say but absolutely brilliant. Easily stole the show as the vicious gangster Rehman Dakait.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sanjay Dutt: A good performance by Sanju brought a grittiness to his police role.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sara Arjun: A bit of a meh showing. To be fair she did not have a whole lot to do, and her character was largely badly written.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Arjun Rampal: The epitome of evil in this movie and Arjun Rampal rose to the challenge extremely effectively. The next best performance after Akshaye Khanna.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Rakesh Bedi: This was the performance that didn&#39;t make sense. This powerful politician being portrayed in a weak and goofy way did not really mesh with the rest of the characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>R Madhavan: A strong showing but was let down by weak writing. Half of his dialogues were not meant to be movie lines but rather overt political messaging. As such at various times he just sounded like a propaganda poster rather than a real person.</li></ul><br/><br/>Music
The music is fantastic really adding to what is going on on screen. Has also added to the virality of the film on social media.<br/><br/>Conclusion
If you can handle the violence and gore, I do recommend this as a good watch. With a sequel slated to be released in a matter of months, this movie did its job in building anticipation for the sequel.<br/><br/>7/10.",2,

rw11036142,AranyakD,,A Masterclass in Acting Buried Under Exhaustive Action,"If you are looking for performances that sear the screen, Dhurandhar is unmissable. The casting is nothing short of a coup, pitting two of the industry&#39;s most intense performers against one another in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. The film thrives when it focuses on the psychological warfare between its leads, who elevate the material far beyond standard genre conventions.<br/><br/>Singh and Khanna: A Volatile Chemistry
The film&#39;s greatest asset is undoubtedly its cast. Ranveer Singh delivers a &quot;feral&quot; and &quot;electrifying&quot; performance as Hamza, stripping away his usual flamboyance to embody a covert operative with simmering intensity. Opposite him, Akshaye Khanna is terrifyingly calm as the antagonist, Rehman Dakait. Khanna steals every scene he is in, proving once again that he is a master of understated menace. When Singh and Khanna share the screen, the tension is palpable; their verbal spars are far more gripping than any explosion the director could conjure.<br/><br/>Indulgent Action Sequences
However, the movie falters significantly in its pacing, particularly during the physical confrontations. While the face-off between Singh and Khanna was highly anticipated, the actual fight sequences feel &quot;made&quot; long-extended well beyond necessity. The runtime drags as the director indulges in exhaustive brawls that seem designed to showcase the stars&#39; stamina rather than advance the plot. These moments of excess dilute the tight, character-driven drama that makes the first half so compelling.<br/><br/>Verdict
Dhurandhar is a must-watch for the acting duel between Singh and Khanna, who are in top form. But be prepared to check your watch during the climactic battles, which overstay their welcome in an otherwise gripping thriller.",1,

Dhurandhar is a gripping film that lives up to its title, presenting a story full of intensity, strategy, and emotional conflict. The movie stands out for its strong narrative drive and layered characters, keeping the audience engaged from the opening scenes to the final act.<br/><br/>The storyline revolves around ambition, power, and the cost of cleverness. Rather than relying only on action or spectacle, Dhurandhar focuses on mind games, moral dilemmas, and shifting loyalties. This makes the film intellectually engaging as well as emotionally impactful. The screenplay is tightly written, with several moments that surprise the viewer without feeling forced.<br/><br/>Performances are one of the film&#39;s biggest strengths. The lead actor&#39;s like ranveer , akshay khanna as rehman dakait deliver a convincing portrayal of a complex character, balancing intelligence, arrogance, and vulnerability with ease. Supporting actors also do a commendable job, adding depth to the narrative and ensuring that even secondary roles feel meaningful. The dialogues are sharp and memorable, often carrying more weight than loud dramatic moments.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the direction is confident and controlled. The pacing is mostly steady, though a few scenes in the middle could have been trimmed for better flow. Cinematography effectively captures the mood of the film, using lighting and framing to reflect tension and inner conflict. The background score complements the story well, enhancing dramatic moments without overpowering them.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a well-crafted film that appeals to viewers who enjoy intense drama with a strong psychological element.

It could have been portrayed better. The connection between the two needed to be shown in more depth. And I didn&#39;t understand why, because of an illegal night party, the police would make so much effort to catch a person the way it&#39;s shown?

But once it began, time simply dissolved. By the time the credits rolled, I wasn&#39;t relieved it was over - I was wishing for more. That&#39;s the mark of cinema that grips you completely.<br/><br/>The music deserves special mention. In most films, it&#39;s treated like wallpaper - stock tracks pasted in to fill silence. Here, the score is as vital as the narrative itself. It breathes with the story, heightens emotion, and becomes inseparable from the film&#39;s identity.<br/><br/>What truly astonishes is how you feel for every character. Even someone like Donga, who could have been a throwaway presence, leaves a lasting impression. That&#39;s not just good writing - that&#39;s direction and casting working in harmony to give dimension to every role.<br/><br/>The sets are jaw-dropping. The attention to detail is obsessive in the best way, creating a world so textured and authentic that you forget you&#39;re watching fiction. This level of craft is rare in Indian cinema, where production design often settles for broad strokes. Here, it&#39;s meticulous, immersive, and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is a clinic: cinematography that frames emotion without vanity, editing that respects rhythm, and sound design that knows silence can be louder than noise. Performances are lived-in, not performed - actors chosen for their ability to inhabit roles, not for their surnames.<br/><br/>Durandhar isn&#39;t just another release. It&#39;s once-in-a-generation cinema - the kind of film that redefines what the medium can achieve.<br/><br/>Verdict: 11/10.

Action is raw and immediate, setting a genre benchmark without fluff. Yet, the lengthy runtime and unnecessary elements make it exhausting rather than exhilarating. Worth a watch for visuals alone. Ranveer Singh anchors the chaos with layered intensity, while brutal gore justifies the adult rating. Background score pulses effectively through high-tension ops. Script overloads on politics, losing focus and emotional resonance by the end. Decent thriller, needs trimming. Strong atmosphere in Lyari&#39;s dangers and clever strategic planning hook early.

Performances feel restrained, realistic, and emotionally grounded rather than theatrical. The direction is tight and confident, refusing to dilute the subject matter for mass comfort. This is a serious film with intent, not a crowd-pleasing spectacle.<br/><br/>What Dhurandhar does exceptionally well is its unflinching portrayal of systemic corruption, political cowardice, and the repeated institutional failure of the Indian state when dealing with Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The film makes it painfully clear how early intelligence warnings were ignored or buried, how responsibility was diffused, and how decisive action was avoided at crucial moments. The portrayal of an impotent government response feels disturbingly close to reality.<br/><br/>The tone is grim and relentless. The violence is graphic and often disturbing. This is not stylized violence. It is raw, brutal, and meant to unsettle. Because of this, it is absolutely not suitable for children below 18. Parents should not underestimate how intense some sequences are.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar does not offer easy catharsis or neat resolutions. It forces the viewer to confront uncomfortable truths and sit with anger, grief, and frustration. That alone makes it stand apart from most mainstream political thrillers.<br/><br/>By the time the film ends, it is clear that this is only part of a larger story. The setup for Part 2 is compelling, and expectations are understandably high.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a bold, hard-hitting film with great acting and direction, unapologetic in its political stance and emotional impact.

1. Both Ranveer Singh and Akshaye Khanna have performed well.<br/><br/>2. Director Adithya Dhar has shown some courage to show the real color of Pakistan.<br/><br/>Negative Points are:
1. The film has failed to show what was going on in Jaskirat Singh&#39;s (Ranveer Singh&#39;s) mind when he was crossing Pakistan&#39;s border. Because, this becomes a one way ticket for most spy agents. They may feel that their life in India ends there.<br/><br/>2. During the climax, Ranveer Singh turns the car towards a forest where SP Chaudhary Aslam (Sanjay Dutt) keeps waiting to kill Rahman Baloch. This deviation was the plan. But was everybody (except Ranveer) sleeping in the car a part of the plan? Well, there is no answer for this in the movie.<br/><br/>3. The movie should have shown at least some plots on how the terrorists travelled from Karachi to Mumbai on ship. How easy/difficult it was for them to reach Mumbai and how did they cross Indian Navy surveillance are not shown the movie.<br/><br/>4. The film has failed to show what was going on in India concurrently during the terror plans at Lyari. There was only one scene that came and went, which showed that the intelligent offices received message from various places, that&#39;s it. Indian audience would expect more about what was happening in India at that time.<br/><br/>5. The acting of Sanjay Dutt as a police officer was very poor. He couldn&#39;t even run properly during the climax chase.<br/><br/>6. Foul language is used more than necessity.<br/><br/>Still the movie is watchable because the reality of Pakistan is shown.",1,

From high-stakes intelligence missions to intense undercover sequences, the movie keeps you edge-seated throughout. The twists are clever, action scenes are top-class, and the performances - especially Ranveer Singh and Akshaye Khanna - are powerful and memorable. The story builds tension perfectly, blending espionage, crime, and emotion with rich world-building and a gripping payoff in the climax.<br/><br/>A must-watch for anyone who loves smart spy thrillers with depth, intensity, and cinematic scale!

Bollywood. Ranveer singh and Akshaye Khana stole the show. Sunjay Dutt failed to impress and looked very forced. The pacing of the movie was good and everything from set and setting was also good. It was refreshing to see the hero playing a subdued role as a henchman and staying tha way yet dominating with his acting. The only part I found strange was the fact that he climax of the movie depended on a coincidence and not a planned move. I am referring to the fact that Ranveer drove the car into the forested area only because all the passengers feel asleep together at the right time and at the right moment. That was too much of a coincidence to accept. If even one of the pass where had stayed awake he could not have driven the car into that area and the climax would never have materialised. Other than that it was a good watchable movie.",2,

While I was looking forward to seeing Akshaye Khanna&#39;s performance due to hype on social media, it was Ranveer Singh&#39;s performance that was the most surprising, in a good way. Akshaye Khanna no doubt is a seasoned actor and carried off his role with such authenticity and conviction. The whole cast actually did a fantastic job and complemented each other well.

Ranveer Singh also delivers powerfully as the undercover agent.

rw11024962,arpanp-38965,,What was that!!!,"Dhurandhar is a razor-sharp political thriller that understands the power of restraint. It doesn&#39;t rely on noise or spectacle to command attention; instead, it pulls you in with strategy, psychology, and a constant undercurrent of danger. This is a film that treats intelligence as its primary weapon-and trusts the audience to keep up.<br/><br/>At the heart of Dhurandhar is a world driven by agendas rather than emotions. The narrative unfolds like a carefully planned operation, where every move has consequences and every character carries hidden intent. The story refuses to divide people into heroes and villains; instead, it presents operators-individuals shaped by ideology, ambition, and survival. That moral greyness is what gives the film its edge.<br/><br/>The performances are one of the film&#39;s strongest assets. The lead commands the screen with a controlled, almost chilling presence, proving that power doesn&#39;t need loudness. Supporting actors elevate the tension further, bringing gravitas, unpredictability, and authority to their roles. No performance feels wasted; each character exists for a reason, and each leaves a mark.<br/><br/>Direction and writing work in perfect sync. The screenplay is tight and intelligent, avoiding unnecessary exposition. Dialogues are crisp, layered, and often loaded with subtext. A single conversation can feel more dangerous than an action sequence-and that&#39;s where Dhurandhar truly shines. The pacing is deliberate, but never dull; it mirrors the mindset of its characters-patient, calculating, and precise.<br/><br/>Visually, the film maintains a grounded, serious tone. The cinematography complements the narrative without drawing attention to itself, while the background score subtly builds unease rather than dictating emotion. The editing keeps the tension intact, especially during moments of strategic confrontation.<br/><br/>What lingers after the film ends is its unsettling honesty. Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t offer comfort or closure. It reflects a world where intelligence can manipulate truth, loyalty is conditional, and victory often comes at a moral cost. It asks difficult questions-about power, nationalism, and ethics-without offering easy answers.",1,
rw11054200,worldofskd,,A action packed spy thriller with a solid antagonist.,"Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The movie was great and keeps the audience on the edge of the seat throughout the whole movie. Portrayal of hostage negotiation by indian secret service, then start of the DHURANDHAR programme by the Indian intelligence service. The epic entrance of our protagonist Hamza (Ranveer Singh) and the career of the antagonist Rehman Dakait/Galoch ( Akshay Khanna) is seen in the action packed scenes of the Lyari Underworld. How he (Rehman) emerges to power in the political field with Hamza&#39;s help and how he establishes his force within the political atmosphere; his connection to Pakistani intelligence to conduct terror attacks is portrayed with raw and vivid imagery. The role of Sanjay Dutt (SP Chaudhuri Aslam) is also relevant to the storyline.<br/><br/>Overall it is violence packed and strongly retains its A+ rating. After his(Rehman&#39;s) death, the story is open for a prequel to Hamza (Jaskirat Singh Rangi)&#39;s story of recruitment to Indian intelligence and his training; for the next movie &quot;REVENGE&quot; to be released in 23rd March 2026.",1,

Powerful performances, realistic action, and strong direction make it a true cinematic escape. Definitely worth watching on the big screen.",1,
rw11072682,sanveer-48500,,Not Worth the Hype,Dhurandhar is a watchable movie that does not live up to the hype. It has copied the violence in Animal and there is not enough depth and character development despite being 3h15 (version that I watched at the Cinema).<br/><br/>I have so much more to say but then there would be too many spoilers in my review.<br/><br/>Just keep in mind that you will not be missing anything if you do not watch this movie.

rw11066455,sankalpsahay,,Absolute disappointment,"Another Government Propaganda and yet another disappointment from Bollywood. Dhurandhar does not carry any meaningful message or story. Off late, I had stopped watching Bollywood movies, at least going to theaters for them. Around so much hype, after a gap of about 3 years, I decided to go watch Dhurandhar and I regret this decision.<br/><br/>Firstly, the movie is quite pushy in terms of spreading the message that the previous governments were a failure. As if, there was no homeland security in India before and all our intelligence agencies were inefficient. So, we totally knew there will be an attack on Mumbai but since just the date of attack was changed from 3rd of Oct to 26th of Nov, our agencies and government turned blind eye towards the threat?<br/><br/>Secondly, coming to the direction, there is ample level of over acting in various scenes. There is unnecessary fight, unnatural ways of hitting and killing people, just a desperate attempt to keep the audience engaged. This is the closest Bollywood can get to in terms of action in a movie. The movie keeps stretching at almost all the scenes without any substance and is boring to the core.",3,

From the very first scene, the movie pulls you into a world of raw emotions, ambition, and moral conflict. The storytelling is intense yet engaging, balancing realism with cinematic flair. Every frame feels purposeful, keeping the audience hooked till the very end.<br/><br/>The performances are the strongest pillar of Dhurandhar. The lead actor delivers a commanding performance, portraying strength, vulnerability, and inner turmoil with remarkable ease. Supporting characters are not just fillers; each one adds depth to the narrative and enhances the overall impact. Dialogues are sharp, meaningful, and memorable, especially during confrontational scenes.<br/><br/>Direction deserves special praise for maintaining a tight pace and extracting powerful performances without over-dramatization. The background score perfectly complements the mood of the film, elevating crucial moments without overpowering them. Cinematography captures the dark and gritty atmosphere beautifully, making the setting feel alive and authentic.<br/><br/>What truly makes Dhurandhar stand out is its underlying message about power, choices, and consequences. It doesn&#39;t glorify wrongdoing blindly but presents a thought-provoking perspective that stays with you long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a compelling, well-crafted film that offers strong performances, impactful storytelling, and emotional depth.

rw11029379,sarangidipu,,"Dhurandhar, A Slow-Burn Spy Thriller That Redefines Intelligence Cinema","Dhurandhar, directed by Adithya Dhar, is a refreshing and gripping addition to Indian spy cinema. Told in a chapter-wise format, much like a premium web series, the film takes its time to build characters, tension, and intrigue-and that patience pays off brilliantly. Ranveer Singh delivers a restrained yet powerful performance as Hamza, an Indian spy who infiltrates Pakistan through Afghanistan and embeds himself deep within the enemy&#39;s ecosystem. From working at a humble juice shop to gaining the trust of Rahman Dakait (a brilliantly understated Akshay Khanna), the film shows intelligence work as it truly is slow, methodical, and psychologically demanding. Akshay Khanna shines as Rahman, a complex antagonist with deep roots in underworld operations, arms supply, and anti-India conspiracies. Arjun Rampal as the ISI chief brings a calm menace, while Sanjay Dutt adds gravitas as a Pakistani DSP caught between duty and chaos. The inclusion of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks gives the film emotional weight and realism. The narrative boldly highlights how intelligence failures and miscommunication can lead to devastating consequences, making the story feel grounded rather than jingoistic.<br/><br/>Despite its long runtime of 3 hours and 22 minutes, Dhurandhar never feels boring. The screenplay remains tight, the twists are earned, and the final act especially Hamza&#39;s calculated endgame involving Rahman shows the cold precision of a trained spy operating without emotional leakage. The film ends on a tantalizing note, clearly setting up a second part slated for 2026, promising deeper revelations about Hamza&#39;s past, his recruitment, and the larger dismantling of enemy networks. Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t rely on loud patriotism or over-the-top action. Instead, it trusts intelligence, patience, and layered storytelling. It feels less like a conventional film and more like the beginning of a serious spy saga. Highly recommended for fans of realistic spy thrillers.",1,
rw11019241,omegaxy,,Reality smeared onto fiction,"Dhurandhar is one of those films that blurs the line between what is real and what is imagined so delicately that the audience is never fully sure which side they&#39;re standing on. It presents itself as fiction, yet every frame feels soaked in truths we recognize from the world around us. This is where the movie finds its strongest voice-reality isn&#39;t simply adapted into fiction; it is smeared across it, staining the narrative in ways that are subtle, unsettling, and deeply engaging.<br/><br/>The story follows an ordinary man caught in extraordinary circumstances, and though the plot takes creative liberties, the emotions and conflicts feel uncomfortably real. The film uses exaggeration not to mislead but to illuminate. It stretches reality just enough to reveal the cracks that we tend to ignore in everyday life. This technique-half-truths woven into imaginative storytelling-creates a strangely immersive experience. You are aware that you&#39;re watching fiction, yet you feel the weight of its truths.<br/><br/>Performances are grounded and sincere, especially the lead, who carries the tension of the film with a rawness that feels unpolished in the best possible way. The cinematography also plays into the &quot;reality smeared onto fiction&quot; theme: scenes shift between gritty realism and stylized surrealism, mirroring the protagonist&#39;s uncertain moral landscape.<br/><br/>If there&#39;s one drawback, it&#39;s that the film occasionally leans too heavily into its metaphorical ambitions, risking confusion for viewers who prefer clear-cut narratives. But for those who enjoy cinema that challenges rather than comforts, Dhurandhar succeeds brilliantly.",1,

rw11018484,PrahladK-843,,A griping tale of a wounded lion,"Dhurandar is exactly what it promises to be: the story of a wounded lion, a man driven by nothing but pure, undiluted rage after witnessing atrocities committed against his own pack, his people. This is not a stylized revenge fantasy, it is a personal war.<br/><br/>From the very first trailer it was clear this would not be your typical rom com disguised as an espionage movie. And the film fully delivers on that warning. It does not shy away from brutality, gore, or the emotional weight behind it. Every gruesome moment feels earned, rooted in real human emotions like anger, grief, and betrayal.<br/><br/>The performances are absolutely gripping.<br/><br/>Every actor brings layers to their character, and nobody is presented as a flat stereotype. Akshaye Khanna especially, there is a scene where his character gets slapped by his wife, and he just stands there, absorbing it. No macho reaction, no exaggerated response. Just raw honesty.<br/><br/>And let us be clear, the brutality in Dhurandar is not hyper masculine chest thumping. The violence is narrative driven, emotional, and reflective. It shows the malice of the antagonists and the psychological descent of the protagonist with precision.<br/><br/>People calling the film polarizing are missing the point entirely. The movie does not target any community or group, it aims directly at those responsible for the cruelty shown. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br/><br/>Viewers just need to widen their lens and see the film for what it truly is,

The movie is detailed with a lot of information and rich &amp; deep world building.<br/><br/>I liked that this movie shows Pakistan in a good way. There are malls, bikes, weapons and so much. Women are respected by their men and they have some freedom. And men are married to only one women. Villains are smart and Aura farmers. And our Protagonist is not over powered. He is a human with his own flaws.<br/><br/>Hatts off to Sachdeva for music. And a lot of Thanks to Aditya Dhar and CBFC.

You cannot just cannot be so closed (while claiming to be open minded) to know that it is is a fact - that Pakistan has a policy to bleed India with 1000 cuts. There is an entire establishment working in Pakistan to kill Indian civilians. If you think this is another propaganda movie, i am sorry to say, you are no different from people you claim to oppose.

Recent Hindi movies have been so bad that I am struggling to finish them on OTT for free, let alone going to theater and spend money on them. I went with zero expectations as I had not seen any trailer for the film. In the first scene itself I was shocked to see Madhwan as Doval, it looked as if Doval was himself there. I found the hype absolutely true and yes, the concerns about gore and brutality are true as well. If they could have left them out, I would say possibly. All characters have executed the roles with perfection. Makeup, dialogues even songs fit so well. I was amazed how could they shoot the movie in such realistic locations and later came to know it was shot in Thailand in a custom made set, now that&#39;s dedication. I was surprised to see Arjun Rampal as Major Iqbal, he was almost unrecognizable. Enough is already said by all, about Akshay Khanna, he&#39;s killed it totally and for the first time I liked Ranveer Singh as well. The movie is long however doesn&#39;t feel that way.

rw11022974,SHREYA_GHOSH,,A true blockbuster film of 2025,"Dhurandhar: 🔥 The best hindi movie of 2025. On the first Monday following its release, I went to see this movie. With its strong screenplay, outstanding writing, and superb world and character development, this 3:30-hour espionage action film has enough substance to keep you interested the entire time. From beginning to end, the film is extremely tight, and the editing and music add to the immersive experience. Since it&#39;s not just Ranveer&#39;s movie, each character was meticulously and subtly developed, and director Aditya Dhar made sure that each character perfectly leaves a lasting impression on the audience. Just like a real chameleon, Ranveer Singh blends into this role while Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, R. Madhavan, Rakesh bedi, Sara Arjun and the rest of the cast make sure the movie runs flawless. As Rahaman Dakait, Akshay Khanna delivers a thrilling performance; his swag, appearance, and dialogue were all extremely powerful. Arjun Rampal&#39;s quiet intimidation as Iliyas Kashmiri (the mastermind of the 26/11 attack) contrasts beautifully with Sara Arjun&#39;s poignant innocence, while Madhavan adds depth and intelligence to play the real-life role of Ajit Doval. Sanjay Dutt adds a new gear to the film, accelerating the pace with his authoritative screen presence and dialogue. The dynamic performances create a rich tapestry of storytelling, elevating the film beyond mere entertainment. Each actor brings their own flair, contributing to a cohesive narrative that resonates deeply with the audience, making it a must-watch for cinema lovers. The climax is a masterwork of suspense that combines emotional and adrenaline weight with ease. The audience is drawn into a whirlwind of suspense, excitement, fear, and emotion as the performances enhance the content even more. As the resolution draws near, viewers are left on the edge of their seats as each character&#39;s journey is meticulously revealed. This is attention-grabbing storytelling that rewards perseverance with memorable cinematic moments. Bravo to the director Aditya Dhar for creating such a genuine spy thriller without squandering the plot with pointless songs or showing off bikini girls or six-pack abs, repeatedly making fun of the same old formula.",1,

rw11024304,rishabh_rajpurohit,,Ride of Bloodbath in Pakistan,"Aditya Dhar&#39;s Dhurandhar is a monumental achievement that shatters the mold of the conventional espionage thriller. It&#39;s not just an action film; it&#39;s a terrifyingly relevant political statement, a stark portrait of the state-sponsored terror infrastructure rooted deep in Pakistan. The film succeeds precisely because it refuses to sanitize the horrific, complex truths that underpin the conflict, offering an unflinching look at the machinery of the ISI and the devastating human cost on both sides of the border.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh&#39;s Career Defining Role
Ranveer Singh as the undercover agent Hamza Ali Mazari delivers what is arguably the most controlled, nuanced, and physically demanding performance of his career. Shedding his usual flair, he embodies the silent, simmering intensity of a man living a dangerous double life. The conflict isn&#39;t just external; it&#39;s a constant, eroding war waged inside his own conscience. The supporting cast, particularly Arjun Rampal as the cold, calculating ISI Major Iqbal and Akshaye Khanna as the magnetic, monstrous crime lord Rehman Dakait, is nothing short of brilliant, creating a web of credible, chilling antagonists.<br/><br/>A Mirror to Reality
What elevates Dhurandhar to instant classic status is its horrifying resonance with current events. The film&#39;s plot, which meticulously details how terror plots against India are conceptualized, funded, and executed, directly echoes the deep-seated concerns following incidents like the recent Red Fort car blast. The movie doesn&#39;t just show a generic &#39;bad guy&#39; it exposes the systematic exploitation:
ISI&#39;s Cruel Exploitation: The film is explicit in its depiction of the Pakistani deep state&#39;s willingness to use its most vulnerable citizens as disposable assets. It highlights the calculated strategy of using financially struggling individuals, often from non-Punjabi communities, for logistics, and the specific radicalization of educated, impressionable Kashmiri youth to execute high-profile attacks. This theme of preying on the poor and marginalized people of Pakistan (non-Punjabi), along with exploited Kashmiris, gives the narrative a powerful, heartbreaking political weight. It reminds the audience that the true villain is the system that breeds and manipulates the very people it claims to protect.<br/><br/>The Unseen Nexus: The seamless, bureaucratic relationship between the ISI, corrupt politicians, and organized crime shown in the film is a brutal reminder of the real-world intelligence reports concerning the nexus that fuels bombings and infiltrations in India. Dhurandhar is a cinematic acknowledgment of the cold, strategic hand of terror that is not merely ideological, but state-sponsored and methodical.<br/><br/>Technical Brilliance and Emotional Impact
Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is a masterclass in tension-building. The pacing is deliberate, establishing the grim, claustrophobic atmosphere of the Karachi underworld. The action sequences are grounded, raw, and visceral, serving the narrative rather than existing purely for spectacle. The technical team from the gritty, authentic cinematography to the pounding, anxiety-inducing background score works in perfect harmony to deliver a genuinely cinematic and unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is not an easy watch, but it is an essential one. It is a bold, uncompromising, and deeply intelligent thriller that moves far beyond Bollywood&#39;s typical handling of cross-border themes. It is a chilling reminder of the constant sacrifices made by agents on the ground and the relentless, politically-driven machinery of terror they fight.",1,

rw11011488,arungeorge13,,An overlong but a pretty satisfying espionage action thriller. [+64%],"Quick thoughts:<br/><br/>1. Patriotism getting the macho packaging is far from my favorite genre, that&#39;s for sure. Dhurandhar is very on the nose from a storytelling perspective, and it&#39;s 200% INTENDED to make your blood boil. Some of it, like the red-screen with a highly disturbing voiceover, works.<br/><br/>2. The writing is simultaneously smart and predictable, weaving in real incidents with fictional events. There are some really INTERESTING stretches, and then, there are some really UNINTERESTING ones. Soft propaganda and snide remarks on pre-2014 government aside, the film stays focused on its espionage-thriller core.<br/><br/>3. The 2-hour long first half only makes it obvious that Aditya Dhar had more material for a web series than a film. The screenplay is extremely dense, going deep into a Pakistani gang war with details that matter more for the moment than overall. The chapterwise divisions are a clear indication too.<br/><br/>4. With a properly etched character like Rehman Dakait, Akshaye Khanna is the standout performer here by a mile. Ranveer Singh only needs to play the silent infiltrator with a limited emotional range (until the end), so it feels like PART 2 will have him showcasing more of his acting chops. Sanjay Dutt&#39;s and Rakesh Bedi&#39;s parts feel like a concerted effort to make one section of Pakistanis look dumb and indecisive; there&#39;s some spontaneous fun to be had in the process, however. Also, Arjun Rampal might be the bigger (and more menacing) baddie that the film deliberately places less focus on.<br/><br/>5. Sara Arjun (the cute kid from Saivam and Deiva Thirumagal has hmm.. grown up!) looks amazing but has absolutely nothing to add to the plot, except be another addition to the &quot;dumb girlfriend universe.&quot; Even her chemistry with Ranveer feels a bit out of place.<br/><br/>6. Shashwat Sachdev&#39;s music is really what kept me hooked for 210+ minutes. Except for that item number and a romantic track, the rest of the OST is FANTASTIC! That also applies to the use of (remixed?) retro songs in various scenes.<br/><br/>7. The violence depicted has a slasher-like vibe at specific points, while sticking to the usual action-thriller aesthetic for the most part. Nothing here is particularly stomach-churning (except maybe THAT post-interval scene), but the director seems to have a clear sense of when to shock the viewer. Screw the insertion of CG blood, though.<br/><br/>8. The VFX in general (blood, explosions, etc.) could look better with the amount of money involved (right?). Yet, the staging of the set pieces and solid set designs deftly mask this.<br/><br/>P. S. Vishwaroopam déjà vu, anyone?",4,

rw11093922,A_D_0068,,Dhurandhar (2025): A Masterclass in Directorial Vision and Acting Ferocity,"Aditya Dhar&#39;s Dhurandhar has transcended the typical &quot;action-thriller&quot; label to become a cinematic milestone. While its scale is massive, the film&#39;s true strength lies in the four pillars that support its weight: the visionary direction of Dhar and the transformative performances of Akshaye Khanna, Ranveer Singh, and Sanjay Dutt.<br/><br/>The Architect: Aditya Dhar With Dhurandhar-
Aditya Dhar proves that Uri was no fluke; he is arguably India&#39;s most precise technician of action. Dhar&#39;s mastery lies in his ability to maintain a &quot;tight&quot; atmosphere even on a &quot;wide&quot; canvas. He treats the lens as an observer, pulling the audience into the dusty, dangerous labyrinth of Lyari with a sensory richness rarely seen in Indian cinema. His decision to blend archival reality with high-stakes fiction creates a &quot;lived-in&quot; intensity that makes every gunshot feel consequential.<br/><br/>The Chameleon: Ranveer Singh (Hamza)
In a departure from his flamboyant public persona, Ranveer Singh delivers a masterclass in restraint. As the deep-cover operative Hamza, Ranveer uses his physicality to tell the story-his hunched shoulders and weathered face speak of a man who has lived in the shadows for too long. It is a simmering, soulful performance that acts as the film&#39;s moral heartbeat.<br/><br/>The Scene-Stealer: Akshaye Khanna (Rehman Dakait)
If there is one reason to watch Dhurandhar multiple times, it is Akshaye Khanna. Playing the sophisticated yet sociopathic Rehman Dakait, Khanna is electric. He brings a &quot;theatrical menace&quot; to the screen, delivering lines with an unpredictable cadence that keeps the audience on edge. It is perhaps the most iconic villainous turn in recent memory-charismatic, terrifying, and impossible to look away from.<br/><br/>The Enforcer: Sanjay Dutt (Chaudhary Aslam)
Sanjay Dutt provides the film with its raw, old-school muscle. As the relentless cop Chaudhary Aslam, Dutt brings a &quot;lion in winter&quot; gravitas to the narrative. His presence provides a perfect counterpoint to the calculated espionage of Ranveer and the madness of Khanna, grounding the film in a sense of grit and legacy.<br/><br/>Final Critical Note (my view)-
Dhurandhar succeeds because it respects the intelligence of its audience while delivering the &quot;masala&quot; thrills they crave. By leaning on the immense talent of its lead quartet, Aditya Dhar has crafted a film that will be studied for years to come as the gold standard of the Indian spy-epic.",1,

rw11006542,posttoricha,,"""A Misguided Spy Drama That Confuses Noise with Narrative""","I watched Dhurandhar yesterday, and here is my review<br/><br/>To begin with, director Aditya Dhar appears to lack the essential depth and research required to create a convincing espionage thriller. A truly compelling spy film demands authenticity, narrative intelligence, and nuanced storytelling - qualities that Dhurandhar consistently fails to deliver.<br/><br/>Instead of substance, the film leans heavily on cosmetic glorification:
<ul><li>thunderous background music,</li><li>hyper-stylized action,</li><li>exaggerated displays of physical strength, and</li><li>forced patriotic triggers designed to emotionally manipulate the audience.</li></ul><br/><br/>This formulaic approach turns the film into spectacle rather than meaningful cinema.<br/><br/>The script takes fragments of real incidents, distorts them for dramatic impact, and then labels the final product as a &quot;patriotic film.&quot; However, nothing in its treatment genuinely reflects patriotism.<br/><br/>What the audience ultimately receives is a third-rate, commercially motivated film whose primary intention seems to be box-office returns rather than artistic or ideological integrity.<br/><br/>The most disappointing aspect is the film&#39;s marketing. Dhurandhar is promoted as an Indian patriotic drama, but at its core, it revolves around Pakistan&#39;s low-grade local political landscape. The disconnect between promotion and actual content makes the film feel disingenuous and directionless.<br/><br/>On a personal note, watching this film with my 10-year-old son turned out to be troubling. Several scenes felt inappropriate and left me deeply uncomfortable as a parent. Throughout the screening, I kept questioning whether bringing him to this film was a mistake.<br/><br/>In fact, the director should take the time to watch an authentic espionage drama like The Spy-a film that succeeds without exaggeration, without glorification, and without manipulating emotions. It is a masterclass in honest storytelling about an intelligence operative. Unfortunately, Dhurandhar seems to operate on the assumption that the Indian audience lacks discernment. Even if that were partly true for some viewers, a filmmaker can never truly connect with an audience that values subtlety, realism, and narrative integrity. He may create a film purely for commercial gain, but he cannot reach those who genuinely appreciate well-crafted spy cinema. Casting R. Madhavan as Ajit Doval and inserting a few real Indian incidents does not automatically make a film patriotic. Instead, it comes across as a calculated attempt to lure attention by exploiting India&#39;s growing wave of performative patriotism. This feels less like a tribute to the nation and more like a strategic move to profit from the charged mindset of the masses.",43,

Rarely does a movie manage to balance non-stop, visceral action with such profound emotional depth.<br/><br/>Every actor, from the leads to the supporting cast, brings an incredible level of passion and raw emotion to their roles. You feel the weight of their choices and the intensity of their courage. The screenplay is lean and impactful, honouring the true story and legends.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the film serves as a deeply respectful tribute to the real-life heroes who sacrificed everything for their nation - Bharat.

rw11011476,SoumikBanerjee1996,,"A gritty, effective espionage drama!","It&#39;s gritty and gory, packed with a wealth of research and information; kind of a rarity in Bollywood&#39; spy endeavours, where mindless entertainment often takes precedence over the significance of the source material.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar, as the director, is breaking the mold without skimping on the entertainment factor, which is refreshing and appreciable.<br/><br/>The film is engaging and soars to incredible heights at certain moments, delivering what audiences typically seek from this genre.<br/><br/>That said, it isn&#39;t without its fair share of flaws. The exposition can feel a bit heavy at times, and the stretched-out screenplay eventually starts to weigh down the pacing and rhythm.<br/><br/>The way songs are integrated is interesting, though especially those that play in the background during key activities.<br/><br/>However, the dance number at the wedding felt unnecessary, as did the entire subplot of Hamza and Yalina&#39;s budding romance. They could have cut that off entirely and nothing would change.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the film does a fantastic job of drawing you into its expansive world filled with ruthless gangsters, smugglers, and corrupt officials.<br/><br/>A standout element is the performances from the main cast, particularly Akshaye Khanna. He doesn&#39;t just play Rehman Dakait, he owns the role, stealing every frame he features in.",2,

rw11019756,BibekB-72,,Totally matured film,"This film is genuinely mature. Although I may not fully grasp all of its political implications, it clearly takes a more thoughtful and grounded approach compared to movies like Pathaan and the Tiger series. Cinema should be made in this manner...honest, unfiltered, and rooted in logic.<br/><br/>In contrast, films like Pathaan and Tiger promote unrealistic and exaggerated scenarios that hide the actual narrative purpose behind a hero&#39;s sudden appearance. For example, Salman Khan&#39;s entry in Pathaan and Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s entry in Tiger happen without any meaningful explanation. This kind of storytelling can be harmful for younger audiences, as it encourages unrealistic expectations and distorts their sense of imagination..People may think those movies(pathan, tiger and many old )are made only for entertainment, but that isn&#39;t entirely accurate. Entertainment should still be logical and follow a clear path. If not, younger audiences may become overly unrealistic and may struggle to nurture real creativity.",1,

rw11047418,aaravg-00326,,Absolute Masterpiece,"Well where do I start...Dhurandhar is a complete example of magnificent filmmaking...probably one of the greatest examples of filmmaking in Bollywood since a very long time....this movie has the potential to be noted as one of the great indian classics like sholay and will be rejoiced for years to come...with ofc excellent performances by the leads (Singh , Khanna)...Rampal,Madhavan and Dutt played their roles to perfection. Not to forget the characters of Jameel (Bedi) and Uzair (Pador) did an amazing job as well...the storyline is polished in a such a way that even without a need of second part the film makes the user wanna watch more even after a huge runtime of 214 minutes. Sara Arjun did a wonderful job in her debut as a senior actress and she fulfilled the requirement of the script perfectly that satisfied the audience&#39;s concern of her age gap with Singh. Their chemistry especially the part where they could have had kiss or possibly sex scenes their romance was done in a very sweet way with the actress kissing the actor&#39;s forehead...which is such a beautiful way to showcase love in a time where kiss/sex scenes are glorified../while also not making the audience uncomfortable with Singh kissing someone 20 years his junior...Khanna once again proved the critics and cinephiles why he is one of the greatest impression actors Bollywood has ever produced...jus absolutely amazing...great work by dhar connecting this with his previous work (URI -2016)...cannot wait to see the second part which explores the back story of Jaskirat Singh Rangi (Singh) while also progressing the storyline with his rule in Lyari with Rehman Dakait (Khanna) now dead. With a budget of just 250 crores this film has surely justified its box office performance with an amazing soundtrack as well. From the &quot;title track&quot; to &quot;ishq jalakar&quot;...from &quot;gehra hua&quot; to &quot;naal nachna&quot;..Shashwat Sachdev has done a wonderful job. 2025 was truly his year with &quot;Bad of Bollywood&quot; and &quot;Kesari 2&quot; as well.",1,

In all their nonsense films, the love angle of ISI and RAW has been shown, everyone knows which film I am talking about and in those films it is shown that people become terrorists because of the government, hence called stupid film. They are only jealous that how did you make a better film than us and how did you act better than us. But at the end it was a very good movie, that of Aditya Sir. Everyone should watch it because it shows the reality of Pakistan and ISI. So those who want to watch the movie must watch it, they will keep watching it.",1,

rw11023100,SRIMANSATWIK,,"I liked the violence, but hated the forced narrative.","This movie wants your blood to boil before your brain even catches up. One minute it&#39;s gripping and properly nasty, the next it&#39;s feeding you a version of reality that feels confidently wrong. I enjoyed the raw punch of it and I also rolled my eyes more than once. If you like your thrillers brutal and loud, you&#39;ll get your money&#39;s worth, just don&#39;t expect the politics to play fair. It has a raw, aggressive energy that I actually welcomed, because the violence feels necessary to sell the world it&#39;s playing in and the threat it wants you to take seriously. Ranveer Singh is excellent when the writing enables him to stay restrained and even when he hangs back his presence still feels central. Akshaye Khanna once again reminded me how much range the guy has and it&#39;s honestly frustrating to remember how underused he&#39;s been for years. When the film locks into that gritty mood it has real bite and I enjoyed the essence of it more than I expected to.<br/><br/>Where it starts to wobble is in how it frames Karachi and Lyari, because it leans into punchline politics instead of clean storytelling. The repeated idea that &quot;whoever rules Lyari rules Karachi&quot; just feels lazy and it ignores how complicated the city&#39;s actual power dynamics are; Lyari is a tiny slice of Karachi, not the whole chessboard. The movie also tries to weld the Lyari gang conflict to 26/11 in a way that comes off forced, because the gang war angle is shown like a neat external conspiracy when it was more of an internal turf conflict tied to local and provincial power games. The &quot;people in Pakistan celebrated 26/11&quot; vibe also felt like a manufactured trigger and the whole &quot;we will destroy India&quot; framing plays like a shortcut designed for applause rather than credibility. Even a throwaway line like the spy repeating that Lyari quote is so overcooked that it becomes unintentionally funny and not in the way the film thinks it is.<br/><br/>On the craft side, the highs are real. The music choices elevate several sequences and the film does know how to build momentum when it wants to. The action is intense and impactful, but the shaky-cam becomes a consistent problem, because it dilutes clarity right when the tension should be peaking. There&#39;s also a strange mismatch in the set pieces: a shorter revenge sequence earlier hits harder than the stretched final hand-to-hand portion, which goes on too long and slips into clunky old-school choreography that doesn&#39;t match the sharper staging elsewhere. I also could&#39;ve done without the wedding &quot;item&quot; number in the exact form it shows up, because a slick retro track would&#39;ve carried that mood better. The ending does give closure while still leaving curiosity about Ranveer&#39;s past and where the story could go next, so it didn&#39;t leave me feeling cheated.<br/><br/>My only real sticking point is the politics, because it&#39;s both loud and weirdly selective. The film announces that it&#39;s inspired by true events and not targeting anybody, yet it leans on real terror footage and call transcripts and that makes the intent harder to shrug off. The emotional punch would still land without hammering the same notes and some of the messaging starts to look like a carefully engineered reminder that a previous government &quot;did nothing&quot; while the current one is painted as the fix, which is blunt in a way that undercuts the story&#39;s stronger core. Add to that one clear weak link in the cast, because Sanjay Dutt looks disengaged and his scenes feel flat even when the direction tries to prop them up. So yeah, I&#39;m still on the positive side with this one, but it&#39;s a film I&#39;d recommend with a straight face only if you can tolerate the propaganda seasoning and the technical overkill in the action.<br/><br/>Part-2... That&#39;s what contains the fun-part for me.",1,

Director ___ (you can add the name) delivers a taut, atmospheric narrative that blends intensity, emotion, and intrigue with remarkable finesse.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, as expected, is the silent storm of the film. His controlled performance, nuanced expressions, and effortless command over tension remind us once again why he remains one of Bollywood&#39;s most refined actors. Every frame he appears in carries weight.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh adds fire to the narrative with an electrifying presence. His kinetic energy is perfectly balanced with moments of surprising restraint. It&#39;s one of his most mature performances, proving his ability to shift gears between flamboyance and emotional depth.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt brings raw gravitas to the film. With his trademark intensity and towering persona, he reinforces why no one portrays morally complex characters quite like him. His screen presence alone elevates the stakes of the story.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal delivers one of his most understated yet impactful roles. His calm menace and internalised conflicts make him an integral part of the film&#39;s dramatic pulse. Rampal&#39;s performance lingers long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan is exceptional - effortlessly charismatic and emotionally grounded. He delivers a performance rich with subtlety, adding layers to the narrative with every scene.

His character offers both emotional weight and much-needed humanity, making him one of the film&#39;s quiet triumphs.<br/><br/>The cinematography is atmospheric without being indulgent, the background score heightens the tension masterfully, and the writing smartly avoids clichés while still appealing to a broad audience. Dhurandhar is crafted with the confidence of great cinema and performed with the conviction of great actors.<br/><br/>Verdict:

rw11011678,TheMovieSearch,,"This is action, straight up action","Dhurandhar (2025) is a wild, high-octane Hindi action film that completely commits to chaos from start to finish, and that full commitment is exactly what makes it so effective. From its opening moments, the film makes it clear that subtlety is not on the menu. Instead, it delivers relentless action, shocking violence, and larger-than-life sequences that feel designed to leave your jaw on the floor. This is the kind of movie that doesn&#39;t ask the audience to settle in quietly - it grabs you by the collar and drags you straight into its world of danger and intensity.<br/><br/>One of the most impressive aspects of the film is its fearless approach to stunt work and action choreography. The sequences aren&#39;t just loud and flashy - they&#39;re imaginative, brutal, and staged with an understanding of how to keep tension alive in every frame. There are moments that border on absurdity, yet the film embraces that tone rather than fighting it. It understands that it is an action spectacle first and foremost, and it leans into that identity without apology. Rather than trying to water itself down for international audiences, it proudly owns its style.<br/><br/>The cast delivers performances that feel fully committed on every level. You can tell these actors weren&#39;t just showing up for a paycheck - they were invested in making this film feel authentic within its heightened reality. Their physicality, their emotional reactions, and their delivery of dialogue all add weight to the outrageous situations they&#39;re placed in. Even during the most unbelievable moments, the performances successfully ground the story enough to keep you locked in and engaged instead of laughing at it.<br/><br/>The direction is a major strength of the film. The director clearly understands how to visually tell a story through movement, framing, and pacing. What makes Dhurandhar especially interesting is how accessible it feels even for viewers who aren&#39;t familiar with Hindi cinema. The storytelling is strong enough visually that you don&#39;t feel lost. You understand character motivations, danger, and emotional stakes through action and expression rather than exposition. That&#39;s not an easy balance to achieve, and this film manages it surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Another standout element is the pacing. The movie rarely slows down, but when it does, it feels intentional. Those brief moments of calm aren&#39;t wasted - they&#39;re used to build tension and prepare the audience for the next explosion of action. The film doesn&#39;t pretend to be something it isn&#39;t; it doesn&#39;t chase prestige drama territory or try to be overly philosophical. Instead, it focuses on delivering a visceral cinematic experience rooted in adrenaline, spectacle, and momentum.<br/><br/>What ultimately makes Dhurandhar work is that it understands its audience. It knows people are coming in for action, danger, and intensity, and it delivers that consistently. Even as a viewer outside of its primary cultural market, the film remains engaging because of how universal its visual storytelling is. You don&#39;t have to fully understand every line of dialogue to feel the stakes, the fear, or the excitement. That&#39;s a testament to strong filmmaking instincts.<br/><br/>In the end, Dhurandhar (2025) stands out as a bold and unapologetic action film that thrives on excess, spectacle, and raw cinematic energy. It may not be for everyone, especially those looking for subtle storytelling, but for viewers who enjoy high-intensity action and fearless filmmaking, it&#39;s a highly entertaining ride. It succeeds by being exactly what it sets out to be: loud, wild, and unforgettable.",3,
rw11067972,Igetnojoy,,A long runtime that earns every minute.,"A three and a half hour film sounds daunting before you walk in, but Dhurandhar makes you lose all sense of time. The storytelling is so well written that you find yourself completely wrapped in it. Inspired by real events, the film does justice to them by presenting things as they were unflinching and honest. The horrifying scenes, the bloodshed, and the humiliation are portrayed without dilution.<br/><br/>The cast is powerful and delivers across the board. Ranveer Singh undoubtedly shines here, but what Akshaye Khanna brings to the screen is on another level altogether. That stare, the hunched posture, and his dialogue delivery mark the work of a master actor. Another performance that deserves mention is Arjun Rampal&#39;s. Based on a real person, he carries the look and presence convincingly. I found myself waiting for him to reappear, wanting more of his screen time, but unfortunately it wasn&#39;t enough, though the sequel does seem promising.<br/><br/>The love angle, the usual ingredient, didn&#39;t quite held my attention.

rw11046139,sudpta,,The Unease It Leaves Behind,"My Detailed Take on Dhurandhar - Craft, Choices, and the Unease It Leaves Behind
I want to begin by clearly stating that Dhurandhar is a technically strong film. The scale, performances, production design, and sheer effort behind achieving this magnitude of filmmaking are evident throughout. Some scenes are genuinely powerful, and the actors look convincing and committed. From a craft perspective, the film largely succeeds.<br/><br/>Yet, as an Indian audience member, I walked out deeply conflicted-not because the film lacked quality, but because its narrative choices repeatedly worked against emotional alignment with the audience.<br/><br/>For most of its 3.5-hour runtime, I felt like I was watching a Pakistani gang-war film with an Indian spy embedded inside it, rather than an Indian spy film about protecting Indian interests. The focus overwhelmingly stays on the rise, dominance, brutality, and internal workings of terror networks. They plan, execute, expand, and adapt on screen with remarkable narrative weight. Meanwhile, Indian intelligence appears reactive, constrained, or simply absent for long stretches.<br/><br/>I understand the premise of deep-cover espionage-that a spy must do morally questionable things to gain trust. That is acceptable and even expected. But in Dhurandhar, the Indian spy&#39;s violent actions largely serve one purpose: to help terrorists trust him more. These actions rarely translate into visible strategic gains for India-no prevention of attacks, no dismantling of networks, no sense that the balance is slowly tilting. This creates a troubling ambiguity: is Hamza meant to be a hero, or a tragic figure failing despite personal sacrifice? The film never clearly answers this, and that confusion weakens the emotional payoff.<br/><br/>One moment that crystallises this problem is the handling of Rehman Baloch. When Rehman is dying earlier in the film, Hamza saves him-despite already being deeply embedded within the group. From an operational and spycraft perspective, eliminating him then would have involved lower risk and higher strategic value. Later, Hamza kills Rehman at a far riskier moment, nearly losing his own life in the process. This decision feels less like strategy and more like plot convenience, designed to stretch the narrative into a sequel. It undermines Hamza&#39;s credibility as a trained operative and makes the arc feel artificially delayed.<br/><br/>Another issue is how Indian intelligence and the Indian state are framed historically. The film revisits events like Kandahar, the Parliament attack, and the Mumbai attacks, but largely through the lens of Indian helplessness and failure. What&#39;s missing is context-intelligence recalibration, behind-the-scenes countermeasures, and long-term strategic responses. Kandahar, for instance, was not simply incompetence; it involved intense diplomatic and intelligence pressure. By omitting that nuance, the cumulative impression becomes unsettling: Pakistani terrorists are shown as &quot;dhurandhar,&quot; while Indian systems are not.<br/><br/>From a pacing perspective, the film feels like an extended setup. In my view, the infiltration arc could have been contained within 1 to 1.5 hours. The remaining runtime should have shown the spy &quot;working his magic&quot;-outmanoeuvring handlers, neutralising threats, and systematically weakening the network. Instead, the audience is asked to wait for catharsis in Part Two. By the end, my adrenaline wasn&#39;t excitement-it was frustration. The film withholds narrative closure while demanding patience.<br/><br/>From a character and emotional alignment standpoint, I also felt something important was missing. While the film understandably shows key terror leaders as dominant-which makes sense from a craft perspective-I wanted to see their vulnerability, not just their power. In Raazi, the protagonist is not physically dominant, but her quiet intelligence and moral resolve give the audience deep satisfaction. In The Family Man, both villains and hero are brutal and competent, but the balance is clear: even when villains win battles, the strategic triumph ultimately lies with India. That balance is missing in Dhurandhar, leading not to tension but to emotional fatigue.<br/><br/>As a neutral viewer, I was also forced into an uncomfortable political reading. The film seems to suggest that earlier Indian governments lacked prudence, while later leadership enabled decisive action. This interpretation may not be intentional, but it emerges naturally from how failures are framed and how Operation Dhurandhar is eventually positioned as a corrective moment. Once the operation is attributed to Ajit Doval, the narrative begins to resemble a historical argument rather than a purely cinematic one. Whether meant to or not, the film opens itself to the charge of political signalling.<br/><br/>Finally, the most puzzling narrative choice for me is Hamza&#39;s backstory. He is shown as a trained, capable, mentally resilient spy-not weak or impulsive. Yet the film roots his recruitment in a criminal past and a life sentence. Even if we assume a softer justification-that he killed to protect his family and is not inherently criminal-the operational question remains: why place someone with such a background in one of the most sensitive, long-duration, high-risk espionage roles imaginable? Deep-cover intelligence work demands extraordinary patience, ideological clarity, emotional discipline, and sustained loyalty over years. This is not about morality but about operational logic. In reality, India has entrusted such responsibilities to rigorously trained defence and intelligence personnel-individuals with proven institutional grounding, such as officers like Mohit Sharma, who undertook covert missions based on professional military conditioning and accountability. Against that reality, the decision to anchor Operation Dhurandhar in a life-convict recruit feels unnecessarily contrived and weakens the film&#39;s realism.<br/><br/>In the end, I don&#39;t dislike Dhurandhar because of poor acting or weak filmmaking. On the contrary, the performances are strong and the ambition is commendable. I dislike it because it prioritises portraying the enemy&#39;s dominance over India&#39;s counter-capability, defers payoff for too long, and leaves the audience questioning the credibility and intent of its own narrative.<br/><br/>For me, it remains a one-time watch-worth seeing for the performances and scale, but emotionally unsatisfying as an Indian spy story. I genuinely hope Part Two restores balance, agency, and closure. If it doesn&#39;t, this first part will age poorly-not because it lacked craft, but because it forgot the audience it was speaking to.",1,

rw11028441,GaneshP-543,,It seems without facts.,"Dhurandar seems like is a textbook example of how ambition without structure can completely derail a film. What starts with the promise of intensity and depth quickly collapses into an irrational, poorly coordinated mess that lacks both direction and purpose.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw of the movie is its absence of narrative logic. Scenes unfold without cause-and-effect, characters appear and disappear without development, and events seem to exist only to fill screen time rather than serve the story. The so-called &quot;chapters&quot; feel randomly stitched together, with no emotional or thematic continuity. Instead of enhancing the storytelling, the chapter format exposes the film&#39;s weak writing and lack of planning.<br/><br/>Equally frustrating is the non-existent ending. The film simply stops rather than concludes. There is no resolution, no payoff, and no sense of completion-leaving the audience confused rather than contemplative. An open ending can be powerful, but Dhurandar mistakes incompleteness for depth.<br/><br/>The characters lack motivation and consistency. Their actions often defy basic logic, making it impossible for the audience to emotionally invest. The film seems more interested in appearing intense and philosophical than actually earning those moments through solid storytelling.<br/><br/>In the end, Dhurandar feels like a collection of disconnected ideas masquerading as cinema. Without a coherent structure, a meaningful conclusion, or coordinated chapters, the film fails to engage, satisfy, or even provoke thought. What could have been a compelling narrative instead becomes an exhausting experience that tests the viewer&#39;s patience.<br/><br/>Verdict: A confusing, irrational film with no narrative discipline-Dhurandar is more chaotic than crelative.",12,

rw11094632,sudarshan-47109,,Entertaining Spy Masala With A Heavy Ideological Undertone,"Watched the Hindi movie Durandhar with subtitles in the theater. It is perfectly fair to say that the film is entertaining, even while dealing with serious subject matter.<br/><br/>The story revolves around planned terrorist attacks involving Pakistan, with fiction skillfully woven around historical incidents. The first half moves at a good pace and keeps you engaged. After the interval, the narrative slows a bit but does not completely lose grip. The climax is pure masala and could easily have been trimmed by about twenty minutes.<br/><br/>I enjoy spy stories, and this movie worked for me at that level. The concept is similar to classics like Day of the Jackal and Eye of the Needle, where fictional characters move through real historical settings. However, this film is not at that level. Those movies felt tighter, subtler, and more grounded. Durandhar borrows the same spy framework but leans far more into commercial cinema and spectacle.<br/><br/>The background score deserves a mention, especially the use of Bhangra music during action scenes, which was energetic and surprisingly effective. The film is packed with stars. Ranveer Singh delivers a solid performance. Akshaye Khanna stays true to his understated style and adds depth. Sanjay Dutt and Arjun Rampal bring screen presence. Madhavan does not stand out dramatically but fits the role well and looks convincing. Seeing Sara Arjun as a grown up was a pleasant surprise, especially after remembering her from the Tamil movie Saivam.<br/><br/>Where the film becomes uncomfortable is its messaging. While terrorism is unquestionably wrong, the narrative often paints an entire country and an entire religion in broad, dark strokes. The use of chants, background slokas, and symbolic cues feels deliberately designed to provoke emotion and reinforce bias.<br/><br/>Durandhar succeeds as an engaging spy thriller but leaves you thinking not just about the story, but also about the intent behind how that story is told.",0,

rw11009870,rana-tanushree,,Brilliant but gory,"It&#39;s a brilliant movie no doubt. Great direction, strong performances, and impressive attention to detail. Akshaye Khanna is outstanding, especially given how challenging his character is. The mannerisms he adopts are spot-on and elevate the role even further. Ranveer Singh is solid and fits his character well. R. Madhavan appears in a look none of us could&#39;ve ever imagined! He truly is a gem of an actor.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt, in my opinion, felt unnecessary. His humour doesn&#39;t land, and his character could&#39;ve easily been removed, though I suppose they wanted someone with a personal agenda against Akshaye Khanna. Rakesh Bedi was excellent in his role, while the new girl could&#39;ve performed better. Gaurav Gera was another surprise! None of us would&#39;ve pictured him in that kind of getup.<br/><br/>The most powerful aspect of the film is how starkly it portrays the gory reality of terrorists - how they think, operate, and inflict fear and &quot;enjoy&quot; watching innocent people die :( It also highlights the immense pressure, pain and challenges the Indian government faces during terrifying times like terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>The movie could easily have been 30-40 minutes shorter. Some of the action sequences are too graphic and difficult to watch. I&#39;ve rated it a 7 primarily because of the excessive gore and the entire Sanjay Dutt segment.<br/><br/>Once again, Akshaye Khanna shines the brightest! He truly deserves multiple accolades for this role. Salute for portraying such a complex character with so much depth and dedication!<br/><br/>Hats off to the entire team and crew.

The same has been thoroughly, cleverly and covertly implemented in the movie.<br/><br/>Patriotism etc have been used up as cover and not impactfully emphasized in the movie presentation.<br/><br/>Definitely, not a recommended movie for anyone considering the distorted effect it creates on viewer&#39;s mind under false identity of patriotism.",11,

rw11002348,juhikumari-23427,,"A bold, uncompromising spy thriller that delivers both substance and spectacle.","Dhurandhar is the kind of spy thriller that grabs you from the very first scene and refuses to let go. It&#39;s intense, atmospheric, and built with a level of ambition that instantly sets it apart from most films in the genre.<br/><br/>At the heart of the story is Hamza, played by Ranveer Singh, who delivers one of the most powerful performances of his career. As a young recruit pushed into a perilous mission deep inside Karachi&#39;s crime-infested underworld, Ranveer brings a fierce physicality and emotional weight to the role. His eyes, his stillness, his bursts of controlled aggression-everything comes together to create a character who feels both dangerous and deeply human. Even without dialogue, he communicates the turmoil of a man trying to stay alive while walking the razor&#39;s edge between duty and survival.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally compelling.<br/><br/>Akshay Khanna is magnetic as Rehman Dakait-calm, sharp, and unsettlingly unpredictable. He doesn&#39;t need theatrics; every glance and pause carries a quiet threat.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt adds gravity with his seasoned presence, grounding the story with maturity and raw strength.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal brings an enigmatic, steady intensity that keeps you guessing until the end.<br/><br/>Together, they form a constellation of performances that elevate the film far beyond a conventional action thriller.<br/><br/>The world-building is one of Dhurandhar&#39;s biggest triumphs. The longer runtime actually works in its favour, allowing the narrative to slowly reveal the tangled web of crime, politics, and terror the characters are navigating. When the second half explodes into high-voltage action and emotional stakes, the buildup feels completely earned.<br/><br/>On the technical front, Vikash Nowlakha&#39;s cinematography paints Lyari&#39;s gritty lanes with immersive realism, while Shashwat Sachdev&#39;s pulsating background score never lets the tension drop. The action sequences are raw, ruthless, and refreshingly grounded, no unnecessary flash, just pure impact.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a rare blend of strong performances, tight direction, and gripping atmosphere. It&#39;s intense without being messy, emotional without being melodramatic, and stylish without losing authenticity.<br/><br/>If you love gritty espionage dramas with powerhouse performances, Dhurandhar is absolutely worth a big-screen watch.",1,

rw11044737,denilkatariya,,Spy thriller,"As far as spy thrillers go, only a handful manage to leave a lasting impression on the big screen. Dhurandhar comes close to joining that list, largely due to its gripping premise and powerhouse performances.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a deeply immersive performance as Hamza Ali, an Indian spy embedded as part of a long-term intelligence operation to destabilize enemy forces from within. His infiltration into the Karachi underworld brings him face to face with Rehman Dakait (Akshaye Khanna), a formidable gangster whose influence extends into the political power structure. Akshaye Khanna is excellent-calm, authoritative, and quietly intimidating-making their dynamic one of the film&#39;s biggest strengths.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of real-life events like the IC-814 hijacking and the Parliament attack, the film also explores the strategic mind of Ajay Sanyal (R. Madhavan), the IB chief attempting to outmaneuver systemic corruption and internal failures by planting assets deep inside enemy territory. As Hamza earns Rehman&#39;s trust, he gains access to key ISI players, steadily climbing the ladder in a dangerous game of deception.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt is menacing as SP Aslam Choudhary, a ruthless cop determined to wipe out the underworld. The performances across the board are strong, supported by striking cinematography and an effective background score that maintains tension.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandhar falters is its runtime and climax. The narrative becomes dense as multiple plotlines unfold simultaneously, and the ending feels underwhelming compared to the buildup. While the action is fast-paced and several scenes land well, tighter editing could have elevated the impact.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is largely a Ranveer Singh-Akshaye Khanna show, offering an engaging glimpse into the dangerous, unseen world of intelligence operatives. Despite its flaws, it stands as a solid and ambitious spy thriller.",0,

I left the theatre in awe - this is the movie everyone has been yearning for 🎬🔥<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is not just a film. It&#39;s a thrilling, immersive experience that shakes you, pulls you in, and refuses to let go. It is a long movie, yet it never feels dull or drawn-out; every moment is gripping. The writing is razor-sharp, the screenplay masterful, and the direction fearless, raw, and grounded - creating a world that feels brutally authentic. All credit goes to the visionary genius, Aditya Dhar. You nailed it, man!<br/><br/>The archival footage from the Parliament attack and 26/11 lands profoundly, a stark reminder that behind this spy thriller lies real history, anguish, and memories our nation still carries.<br/><br/>And the performances... 😳🔥🔥
Ranveer Singh is the anchor of the film. He carries it entirely on his shoulders. He doesn&#39;t just play the character - he becomes it. His piercing, expressive eyes convey more than words ever could. Every glance, every silence, every subtle emotion lingers. He brings depth, authenticity, and ferocious intensity to the role of a spy, making you root for him completely. That line, &quot;Ghayal hoon, Isiliye Ghatak hoon&quot; - oh man, chills everywhere.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna dominates every frame he&#39;s in. Magnetic, commanding, captivating, and powerful, he elevates the energy and leaves a lasting imprint.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt accelerates the pace with his formidable screen presence. R. Madhavan and Arjun Rampal may have limited screen time but their presence is memorable and impactful.<br/><br/>The background music flows seamlessly, enhancing every beat, while the carefully placed old classics add nostalgia, charm, and unexpected emotion. Masterfully executed by Shashwat Sachdev.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a must-watch - raw, emotional, gripping, exhilarating, and utterly unforgettable.",1,
rw11008264,aasfakhatoon,,love intense political thrillers and strong dialogue-driven cinema.,"The film opens with an intense and gripping scene - a plane hijack by terrorists. Indian Intelligence Bureau chief goes for negotiation but is captured, and just then the heroic entry sets the tone. From this moment, the story revolves around Hamza, a character whose life takes an extremely difficult turn when he is sent to Pakistan as a spy by the Indian Intelligence.<br/><br/>Hamza lives a brutal life among gang wars and political corruption. He struggles for survival, working at a juice stall while planning to infiltrate the Rehman Balouch gang - the most powerful family in Pakistan. The Balouch family history is dark: one son supporting the rival party, and another son, Rehman, controlling power.<br/><br/>During a wedding organized by Hamza&#39;s juice stall, Rehman Balouch&#39;s elder son arrives, and his stepbrother tries to assassinate him. A younger son suddenly appears, and although Hamza fails to save the elder one, he heroically saves the younger boy. This leads to the powerful entry of Rehman Balouch, played by Akshaye Khanna. His wife&#39;s emotional slap - full of pain and rage - is one of the most satisfying scenes. Her breakdown and Rehman&#39;s silent hug made the moment incredibly real.<br/><br/>Hamza refuses reward money saying, &quot;I am Balouch. I have already lived a tough life. This was my duty.&quot; That dialogue hit hard.<br/><br/>Then enters the political uncle - a perfect depiction of a poisonous politician, like a dark snake. He forces Rehman to wait till elections and not take revenge. But Hamza convinces him that if he stays silent, he has already lost. They strike back, killing the attackers. In a shocking moment, Rehman even kills his own mother when he learns a dark secret of lineage - a brutal scene that changes everything.<br/><br/>The film heavily relies on punchlines, retro background music, and intense emotions of patriotism and betrayal. Then the heroine enters - the politician uncle&#39;s daughter, only 19, while Rehman is in his 40s. Their chemistry is emotional, not physical - not even a single adult scene, only a forehead touch conveying everything.<br/><br/>Rehman joins ISIS for selfish political power, delivering guns and bombs. The film connects to real history by showing 26/11 attacks, reminding audiences never to forget. It portrays ISIS brutality - killing Balouchi people, raping women, murdering kids. These scenes shake the soul.<br/><br/>Then comes Chaudhary Aslam, played by Sanjay Dutt - suspended for 7 years. His entry is full of raw abusive language, pure thrill. Arjun Rampal as ISI agent performs superbly.<br/><br/>Hamza becomes aggressive seeing 26/11 and plans to kill Rehman. Meanwhile betrayal unfolds - a servant involved, fingers cut brutally, and Hamza receives a video proving political conspiracy. To save his career, the politician leaks Chaudhary&#39;s base and attacks happen. Rehman joins politics, becomes powerful, but Hamza hunts him down.<br/><br/>A thrilling car-fight chase scene ends with Rehman shot in the neck. Hamza pretends to save him, sending him to hospital in an auto, but he dies. The ending clearly hints a sequel.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal is fierce like a storm, the fight scenes, music, everything electrifying. Heroine looks innocent but stunning in party scenes. Typical Bollywood - hero can be father&#39;s age and it&#39;s okay.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan as Intelligence Chief - cold face, brilliant strategy. Before 26/11 he warns government about attacks but ignored. The film shows corruption, fake currency printing, black money, terrorist support and political betrayal.<br/><br/>The movie&#39;s spine is powerful performances:
Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, the politician uncle, and Madhavan - every character sharp and unforgettable.<br/><br/>And the dialogue that stays with you:
&quot;Ghayal hoon, isliye ghatak hoon.&quot;
At the end Madhavan reveals Hamza&#39;s new identity, sending him again into the field:
&quot;Samay kitna bhi bura ho... acchi baat yeh hai ki badalta hai.&quot;
The entire movie structured like chapters - butterfly effect, jinn, destiny. Hard scenes, heavy emotions, patriotism, betrayal - all balanced. Not a bad film at all - actually very good. Powerful. Human. Emotional. Real.<br/><br/>My rating:(4/5)
A must-watch for those who love intense political thrillers and strong dialogue-driven cinema.",0,

This is what Indian audiences have waited for so long where a superstar is not worshipped but story has been given priority, where one man is not carrying the entire burden of the movie, but all actors whether lead or supporting actors has been portrayed magnificently. In fact Akshay Khanna was supposed to be supporting actor but overshadowed Ranveer Singh completely.

While officially a work of fiction, the film pulses with an authenticity that makes it feel like an undercover documentary.<br/><br/>The Gold Standard of Research
The secret sauce of Dhurandhar is clearly its depth of research. With significant inputs from veteran journalist Aditya Raj Kaul, the film avoids the &quot;filmy&quot; tropes usually found in Indian espionage or political dramas. Instead, it offers a granular look at strategic affairs and internal security. This realism is bolstered by character designs-faces and names-that subtly mirror real-world figures, creating an instant, relatable connection for the audience.<br/><br/>Structural Precision: Chapters of Intent
Despite its significant runtime, the film never wavers in its momentum. This is largely thanks to a chapter-based structure.<br/><br/>Clear Objectives: Each segment has its own mission and payoff.<br/><br/>Pacing: This prevents the narrative from sagging in the middle, ensuring that the audience remains locked into the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of every scene.<br/><br/>Clarity: It breaks down complex political maneuvers into digestible, high-stakes goals.<br/><br/>Atmosphere and Performance
It is rare for a long-form movie to maintain pin-drop silence in a theater. This speaks to the immersive direction and the nuanced performances of the cast.

rw11010170,prakharkrishnatripathi,,Dhurandhar,"Dhurandhar is a high-scale espionage-crime thriller that clearly aims to be larger than life. Directed with ambition and packed with powerful faces, the film works strongly in performances and technical detailing, though it slightly stumbles in pacing and certain casting choices.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh, as the undercover operative, delivers a powerful and intense performance. He balances restraint and aggression well, especially in emotional and action-heavy scenes. While a few patriotic-heavy dialogues feel exaggerated, his physicality and screen control become one of the film&#39;s biggest strengths and keep the narrative engaging.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna completely steals the show as the crime lord. His calm menace, controlled dialogue delivery, and psychological dominance make him the most memorable character in the film. He elevates every scene he appears in and is widely regarded as the strongest performance. His role gives Dhurandhar its real psychological depth.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt as the SP is where opinions divide. The character itself is very strong-a feared, legendary officer-but the casting feels slightly mismatched. Dutt&#39;s style feels dated for this sharp, grounded role. Actors like Manoj Bajpayee, Pankaj Tripathi, or Nawazuddin Siddiqui would have suited this character better with their natural intensity and realism.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan and Arjun Rampal give solid, dignified support, adding weight to the intelligence and power structures within the story. The child actor adds emotional depth and a strong human connection to the film.<br/><br/>The music and background score are major highlights. They elevate action scenes, emotional moments, and tension beautifully. Several tracks leave a lasting impact even after the film ends. The jump cuts and chapter-style editing work brilliantly in high-energy sequences but feel abrupt during emotional transitions.<br/><br/>The biggest weakness remains the long runtime and uneven pacing, especially in the second half. Still, Dhurandhar stands as a stylish, performance-driven, and powerful big-screen experience.<br/><br/>The film often leans into loud ideological and hyper-dramatic expression instead of subtle psychological tension.

rw11005689,HollyGolightly123,,Bigger Bolder but not better movie from Dhar,"A film from the maker of Uri - arguably one of India&#39;s finest war/mission movies - naturally raises sky-high expectations. Sadly, Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t live up to them.<br/><br/>What we get is a full-throttle action spy thriller that&#39;s all muscle and very little heart. It&#39;s so aggressively macho that it often tips into corniness. The characters, loosely inspired by real-life figures, are inherently fascinating, and weaving fictional gang wars, betrayals and political intrigue with actual historical events is a smart touch. Yet the plot itself feels painfully familiar - we&#39;ve seen this cocktail many times before.<br/><br/>The casting is stellar on paper, but the performances remain merely serviceable. The single biggest crime, however, is the bloated 3-hour-32-minute runtime. Huge chunks are spent on sluggish character introductions, pointless chapter breaks, a completely gratuitous item song, and endless slow-motion shots that add zero impact could have been trimmed without losing a thing.<br/><br/>The romantic track neither distracts nor convinces, though it does serve the story to some extent.<br/><br/>With tighter editing and a little more emotional depth, Dhurandhar could have been a gripping thriller.

rw11004630,TheRealDarkFang,,LADIES AND GENTLEMAN YOU ARE NOT READY FOR THIS!!!,"&quot;Dhurandhar&quot; is that one film for which any amount of appreciation feels too little; even if my review reaches its end, Dhurandhar&#39;s roar simply won&#39;t.<br/><br/>For the first time in Indian Cinema, the audience has witnessed something this grand, this powerful, and this overwhelmingly well-crafted. I genuinely want to know how Sir Aditya Dhar managed to create a masterpiece of this scale.<br/><br/>The film is packed with moments that send adrenaline rushing through your veins, with goosebumps that feel like they&#39;re roaring straight into your soul. The editing, the timing, the catchphrases, the character introductions-everything is executed with such precision that I could easily write multiple reviews just to cover every single quality of this film.<br/><br/>There isn&#39;t even one moment where the movie fails to deliver. The music, the set locations, and the performances of every actor are stunning-so naturally done that they stop feeling like actors and completely transform into their characters. That level of immersion is rarely seen in Bollywood.<br/><br/>Who would&#39;ve thought a patriotic film could be this perfect? Even with a lengthy runtime of 3 hours and 34 minutes, not a single millisecond feels boring or stretched. I honestly didn&#39;t even realize when the time flew by. The movie doesn&#39;t revolve around just one character; it explores each character deeply, giving all of them proper screen time and pacing in a way I&#39;ve never seen before in Indian Cinema.<br/><br/>Being an 18+ R-rated film, it uses its rating in the correct way-maximizing the intensity without dipping into unnecessary vulgarity. The most interesting thing is that despite being R-rated, there isn&#39;t a single lewd scene, which immediately puts it above films that rely on kissing or lust to boost popularity. This film knows what it&#39;s doing and never compromises its integrity.<br/><br/>Even the item song wasn&#39;t over-focused, and that restraint made it stand out more. The pacing doesn&#39;t break, the theme doesn&#39;t shift; the film stays loyal to what it wants to show and why it is showing it. It&#39;s spectacular to witness, mesmerizing in every second.<br/><br/>Bollywood spy-action-thrillers or real-life-based films usually try to show that maybe the villain has a soft side or that India&#39;s agency could be wrong. This film doesn&#39;t play that game. It shows the truth, the bravery, and the emotions of what an actual spy or agent goes through and how they handle impossible situations.<br/><br/>This film has all my respect. The decision to avoid glorifying death or over-the-top gore was brilliant. It keeps a realistic approach, making you feel like you&#39;re right there in the scene, witnessing everything with your own eyes. From the action choreography to makeup, from VFX/CGI to all the departments we know and don&#39;t know-every single thing is perfect. And I hope, and even believe, that the next part will carry the same perfection.<br/><br/>IF YOU HAVE READ MY REVIEW ALL THE WAY TILL HERE, THEN JUST GO WATCH THE FILM. GO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT TOWARDS OUR BHARAT, OUR NEW BHARAT. MOVIES LIKE THIS DESERVE TO BE MADE AND PROMOTED, MOVIES THAT SHOW REALISM AND BRAVENESS LIKE NO OTHER. ONLY YOUR SUPPORT CAN MAKE THIS A BLOCKBUSTER AT THE BOX OFFICE.<br/><br/>I DON&#39;T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS FILM WILL EARN, BUT IT IS ALREADY A BLOCKBUSTER, AND NOTHING CAN STOP IT FROM BEING ONE. HELP OUR NATION-JUST LIKE CHINA SUPPORTED NE ZHA 2. WAKE UP, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! YOU ARE NOT READY FOR THIS!!!",2,

It&#39;s like the writers were playing a game of &quot;Pin the Blame on Pakistan&quot; and went full WWE smackdown on the map.<br/><br/>First scene: Plane hijack? Pakistan.<br/><br/>Second scene: Parliament attack? Pakistan.<br/><br/>At this point, I&#39;m waiting for a scene where someone in India stubs their toe, and the camera dramatically zooms in on a made-in-Pakistan chair.<br/><br/>Then it gets better. They&#39;ve got Lyari town running a full-service destabilization package: weapons to Kashmir, and they&#39;re printing fake rupees to crash the Indian economy? Bro, Lyari&#39;s got more side hustles than a Mumbai tapori with three phones!<br/><br/>And don&#39;t get me started on Major Iqbal-apparently, this guy is like the Bogeyman of Bollywood Spy Universe. Taj Hotel attack? Him. Bad weather in Delhi? Probably him. Wifi not working? Definitely him.<br/><br/>The obsession is so next-level, it&#39;s almost adorable. Like, in every action scene, some hero has to growl, &quot;Ghar ke ghus ke marenge!&quot; and you can almost hear the director whisper, &quot;Yes beta, sleep well tonight.&quot; It&#39;s their version of counting sheep-except the sheep are all wearing Pakistani uniforms and getting blown up in slow motion.<br/><br/>At this rate, I won&#39;t be shocked if the next plot reveals that Pakistan is also behind India&#39;s traffic jams and rising tomato prices. Modi Vakht really said: Why make fiction when you can make fan-fiction about your neighbors?<br/><br/>It&#39;s not a movie-it&#39;s a national therapy session with VFX and a patriotic soundtrack.

The film follows Hamza Ali Mazari (Ranveer Singh), a shadowy Indian operative who infiltrates the city&#39;s powerful mafia network, rooted in the Lyari gang wars, to dismantle terror operations from within. Told across multiple chapters, the narrative unfolds with deliberate, immersive world-building, drawing viewers into a brutal, morally murky universe that stretches close to three and a half hours. Remarkably, the runtime seldom feels exhausting, thanks to Dhar&#39;s confident, tightly controlled storytelling.<br/><br/>One of the film&#39;s standout elements is its music and background score. By reimagining 70s and 80s Bappi Lahiri classics within a modern sonic framework, the soundtrack becomes an integral narrative force, sustaining momentum and amplifying the film&#39;s raw energy.<br/><br/>While &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; is positioned as a spy thriller rooted in the familiar RAW-versus-ISI conflict, its soul lies elsewhere. At heart, it resembles a &#39;Godfather&#39; style crime saga, an epic of power, loyalty, and betrayal set against Karachi&#39;s violent underworld. The scale and structure strongly suggest the foundation of a trilogy rather than a standalone film.<br/><br/>That said, the film isn&#39;t without flaws. Despite being set in the past, certain production design elements feel conspicuously contemporary and occasionally generic, slightly disrupting the period authenticity. The screenplay also slips into familiar stereotypes-such as a terrorist sneering, &#39;Hindus are darpok&#39;, a reminder of Bollywood&#39;s enduring reliance on well-worn narrative shortcuts.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a commanding return to form, reclaiming his position at the top with a performance that is layered, controlled, and deeply internalized. Sporting long hair, a rugged beard, and an intense, unflinching gaze, his appearance may invite superficial comparisons to Ranbir Kapoor&#39;s &quot;Animal&quot;, but the tonality and emotional register are vastly different. Singh plays Hamza with restraint and menace, allowing silence and stillness to do much of the work. The supporting cast including Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna, Arjun Rampal, Rakesh Bedi, and Danish Pandor, add gravitas and texture, while Sara Arjun leaves a pleasant impression in her role.<br/><br/>An ideological extension of Uri&#39;s defining line &quot;Yeh naya India hai, yeh ghar mein ghusega bhi aur maarega bhi, Dhurandhar is unapologetically violent and unflinchingly long.

The storytelling feels overloaded with forced patriotism, making the narrative preachy rather than powerful. The portrayal of Pakistan is overly dark and simplistic, which removes any sense of realism or nuance from the conflict.<br/><br/>There are no real wow moments, no engaging twists or turns, and nothing that truly surprises. The film moves in a very predictable direction, making the experience feel flat despite its scale.<br/><br/>The hero-heroine pairing is another weak point. The chemistry doesn&#39;t work, and the noticeable age difference makes their scenes uncomfortable at times - occasionally feeling more like a father-daughter dynamic than a romantic pairing.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar has good visuals, performances, and music, but lacks freshness, emotional depth, and memorable moments.",1,

To quote him, &quot;Cinema remembers the brave, not the agreeable,&quot; and that line fits this film perfectly.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Akshaye &quot;Aura&quot; Khanna absolutely eats every scene he&#39;s in. So damn satisfying to see him finally get his due...charisma is so unreal, you end up rooting for him without even realizing it. Ranveer clearly understood the assignment, calm and composed when needed, absolute wrath of god when it matters. Arjun Rampal is menacing as hell and really needs to keep working with directors like this. Sanjay Dutt genuinely surprised me, way better than expected. Sara fits perfectly, gorgeous and vulnerable where required, and the supporting cast is solid across the board.<br/><br/>The action choreography is stylized but purposeful, it actually serves the narrative instead of existing just for spectacle.

Ranveer brings that calm but deadly intensity. Akshaye Khanna barely speaks yet steals every frame. Arjun Rampal and Madhavan add real weight, and Sanjay Dutt is a complete powerhouse.<br/><br/>What really surprised me was how real everything felt. The shootouts, the tension in every mission, the details around the Parliament attack and 26/11... nothing feels exaggerated.

From the very first scene, it pulls you into a world built on fear, power, and deception, and it never lets go. The story of an undercover Indian agent infiltrating Karachi&#39;s mafia-terror network is handled with remarkable maturity. Instead of relying on typical spy clichés, the film focuses on psychological depth, moral conflict, and the dangerous grey zones of loyalty and identity.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers one of the strongest performances of his career. His transformation from a determined officer to a man slowly consumed by the world he&#39;s pretending to belong to is incredible to watch. Akshaye Khanna is equally brilliant - calm, clever, and quietly terrifying. Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhavan, and Arjun Rampal add immense weight to the narrative, making the film feel truly epic in scale.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp and layered. Every scene has purpose, every conversation pushes the story forward, and every character adds a new dimension to the central conflict.

Velu Naicker vs. Reddyar - with an Indo-Pak undercurrent engineered as deception.,"It&#39;s a well-made film and an engaging thriller-but it is not a spy thriller, at least not yet.<br/><br/>The film lifts heavily from Nayakan, almost scene for scene:<br/><br/>Rehman&#39;s son being killed by rivals mirrors Surya&#39;s death.<br/><br/>The senior dacoit gang being wiped out at multiple locations in parallel is straight out of the sequence where the Reddiyars are eliminated after Surya&#39;s death.<br/><br/>The last rites of Rehman&#39;s son are visually and emotionally identical to Surya&#39;s funeral-religion aside.<br/><br/>Rehman stepping onto the balcony and waving to supporters after being rescued from the police is a clear echo of Nayakan&#39;s iconic balcony scene.<br/><br/>Nayakan works for Tamils; Rehman works for Balochs-both positioned as protectors of marginalized communities in their respective territories.<br/><br/>Rehman kills the senior dacoit; Nayakan kills the senior Reddiyar.<br/><br/>Rehman runs schools and hospitals for Balochs; Nayakan does the same for Tamils.<br/><br/>And this list could go on endlessly.<br/><br/>If anything, I&#39;m proud that Nayakan continues to influence Indian filmmakers decades later.<br/><br/>The film also borrows liberally from another classic gangster movie-Satya (Hindi). The entire infiltrator/outsider arc comes from there. Satya enters Mumbai as an outsider, works menial jobs (doodh-soda, anyone??), and gradually enters Bhiku Mhatre&#39;s gang. The scene where Ranveer Singh is shown his flat in a busy Mumbai locality, while Rehman&#39;s backstory is explained, is an almost exact lift.<br/><br/>Audiences today have short memories and are easily distracted. Label it a &quot;spy thriller,&quot; and many will miss how deeply it is stitched together from films people have already watched a hundred times-Nayakan and Satya.<br/><br/>Yes, Aditya Dhar has clearly done extensive &quot;research&quot; on Nayakan and Satya. And yes, I enjoyed the film. But I genuinely wish he had acknowledged Mani Ratnam and Ram Gopal Varma.<br/><br/>That&#39;s where Anurag Kashyap stands apart. In Gangs of Wasseypur, he openly acknowledged Bala, Ameer, and Sasikumar. Inspiration is fine. Borrowing is fine.

Action sequences are choreographed with precision and flair, radiating pure fire with every punch and chase.

Overall, this is a solid 8/10.<br/><br/>As for the propaganda angle-yes, the film definitely leans into certain political messaging. It openly criticizes previous governments and positions the 2014 (present-day) administration as the turning point in India&#39;s fight against terrorism.

The supporting cast is equally effective, ensuring that even smaller roles feel purposeful and well-etched rather than ornamental.<br/><br/>A special mention must be made for the background score, which stands out as truly exceptional. It heightens tension without overpowering scenes and plays a crucial role in sustaining the film&#39;s brooding, high-stakes tone. The technical departments work in impressive harmony. The cinematography captures both scale and intimacy with finesse, while the editing ensures smooth scene-to-scene transitions that enhance narrative clarity rather than disrupt it.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction reflects confidence and maturity.

The BGM pulses through every high-tension moment, amplifies every emotional beat, and keeps you hooked scene after scene.<br/><br/>What surprised me the most is how effortlessly the film sustains its momentum over a massive 3 hours and 30 minutes. In an age where even two-hour movies feel stretched, Dhurandhar turns its long runtime into a strength. Not once does your attention wander. There isn&#39;t a single dull frame, and the pacing is so sharp that you barely register how much time has passed.<br/><br/>Another bold move by the filmmakers is the unapologetically graphic violence-something you rarely see executed with such rawness and intensity in Hindi cinema. The action sequences have weight, brutality, and a kind of grim authenticity that lingers long after the scene cuts. It&#39;s not violence for shock value; it&#39;s woven into the very fabric of the story, heightening both the stakes and the emotional payoff.<br/><br/>And the audience reaction? That, in itself, was an experience. Even after the final scene ended, people simply refused to leave. Everyone just sat there, stunned, excited, whispering theories, soaking in the impact of what they had just witnessed. You could feel the anticipation in the air.<br/><br/>Now the countdown begins-for March 19, 2026, when the second installment drops.

rw11026959,shuklaabhi-47514,,True Indians please please dedicate 3 hrs,"Hi viewers,<br/><br/>This movie is largely inspired by real events. It highlights how threats can exist all around us and emphasizes the importance of strong, patriotic leadership at the central government level to tackle terrorism and protect national security.<br/><br/>The screenplay is decent-nothing extraordinary-but it could have been sharper in certain areas. Since the film is based on a true story, it&#39;s understandable that not every detail could be revealed. Still, the narrative feels believable, and I trust the intent behind the storytelling.<br/><br/>As for the performances, everyone has done justice to their roles. There are no over-the-top star moments or attempts to overshadow the story-no flashy Akshay, Ranveer, or Sanjay moments. Instead, every actor fits naturally into the film, and that collective effort works well for the kind of story being told.<br/><br/>Overall, it&#39;s a sincere film with a serious theme, driven more by realism than cinematic hype.",0,
rw11027042,bsangramsing,,Dhurandhar: A Fearless Spy Thriller Exposing Weak Politics and Celebrating National Strength,"Dhurandhar stands out as a bold, high-impact spy-action drama that combines powerful performances, gripping action, and strong nationalist emotion, making it highly effective on the big screen.<br/><br/>One of its most talked-about aspects is how the film&#39;s narrative portrays Congress-led governments in a sharply negative light, depicting them as politically weak, compromised, and willing to sacrifice national interest for power, including appeasement of Pakistan, erosion of India&#39;s global reputation, and weakening of the country&#39;s strategic strength-all shown within the film&#39;s storyline. This political angle gives the movie an extra layer of intensity and controversy, which many viewers find courageous and refreshing.<br/><br/>Alongside this, the film excels in performances (especially Akshaye Khanna and Ranveer Singh), realistic action, tense dialogues, strong background score, and large-scale storytelling that keeps the audience emotionally invested. Though the runtime is long and a few sections feel stretched, the film&#39;s conviction, scale, and unapologetic stance outweigh its flaws.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a must-watch for viewers who enjoy intense spy thrillers, strong nationalist themes, and politically charged storytelling that doesn&#39;t hold back.",0,

He conveys immense menace and danger with subtle expressions-a smile, a glance, or just the stillness of his posture. He&#39;s an intense, family-man gangster who, according to some reviews, nearly overshadows the protagonist with his terrifying screen presence.<br/><br/>The Viral Entry Scene: His introduction scene, featuring the viral track &quot;FA9LA&quot; by Flipperachi, is a cinema moment that has captivated audiences.

From the very beginning, the story pulls you in with its strong emotional foundation, making every scene feel meaningful and connected. What truly makes this film impressive is the balance between action and storytelling. The action sequences are intense without being overdone, and each moment serves a purpose in moving the story forward. Nothing feels forced or unnecessary, which is rare in many commercial action movies.<br/><br/>The performances are another major highlight. Every actor delivers their role with sincerity, giving the film a sense of depth and authenticity. You can feel the emotions, the struggles, and the motivations of the characters. The direction is tight and focused, keeping the pace steady while still allowing room for the story to breathe. The cinematography adds to the realism, capturing both quiet moments and high-energy scenes with equal skill.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is not just an action entertainer but a complete cinematic experience.

The violence, long runtime nothing bores this movie. Still feels movie ended so fast. Ranveer Singh really stole my heart as a spy. Waiting for part 2. The music is top notch. Everyone should watch this movie in theaters. Support this True movie so that others will take more true movies.",0,
rw11016233,officialkingayush,,Change for the indian spy cinema scene,"Watching Dhurandhar felt like cinematic electricity - exactly the kind of film that reminds you why you go to the movies. The way Ranveer Singh&#39;s character blends into the gritty gang world of Rehman Dakait (as fictionalized in the film) is brilliant - he&#39;s not the flashy hero, but the silent, calculating agent whose quiet presence anchors the entire story. As you said: everything felt &quot;perfect.&quot; That immersive underworld, the tension, the danger - it all felt real.<br/><br/>But the real thunderbolt of the movie is Akshaye Khanna. His portrayal of Rehman Dakait is magnetic. Every time he enters a scene, the energy changes. His aura - from cold menace to unpredictable violence - is so potent that it lifts the film beyond a typical thriller. Critics too called his performance a &quot;masterclass,&quot; and many agree that he steals virtually every moment he&#39;s on screen.<br/><br/>The supporting cast - including veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Rakesh Bedi - also deliver solid performances. Bedi&#39;s character - a crafty politician - adds depth and unpredictability to the underworld-politics game. The side characters, as you felt, are all &quot;dhansu&quot; - they don&#39;t feel like padding but actual players in this dangerous world. Overall, the ensemble works as a tightly-knit gang: each adds flavour, weight, and intensity.<br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the direction by Aditya Dhar deserves huge credit. The world-building - recreating the gang-ridden underbelly, the political machinations, the moral ambiguities - is immersive and textured. The film unfolds like a raw gangster saga rather than a typical glam Bollywood thriller. The background score and music complement the vibe, amplifying every moment of tension, betrayal or brutality.<br/><br/>Of course - and even critics agree - the film isn&#39;t without flaws. At nearly 3.5 hours, it drags slightly in the second half. Some scenes linger a bit too long, and a few subplots seem set up more for future installments than satisfying resolution now. But for you - and clearly many fans - that&#39;s a small price to pay for such a powerful, engrossing ride.<br/><br/>In short: Dhurandhar delivered - and then some. What you described as &quot;every character being dhansu,&quot; the gritty atmosphere, the perfect blend of Ranveer&#39;s undercover calm and Akshaye&#39;s killer aura - all of that came together to create one of the most enthralling Bollywood thrillers in recent years.

The narrative is gripping and unapologetic, rooted firmly in the complex geopolitical realities of the subcontinent - realities shaped by proxy wars, cross-border terrorism, and strategic silence on the global stage.<br/><br/>The director has done complete justice to the subject, and the casting director deserves special praise for handpicking actors who fit their roles to perfection. A special mention for the background score - what music!

Everything felt balanced. The story unfolds smoothly, the pacing works, and the action is tight and grounded, thankfully none of that exaggerated, cartoonish chaos you&#39;d expect in something like a Rohit Shetty film.<br/><br/>This movie really proves that, in the right hands, Ranveer Singh can absolutely shine and be shaped into a true superstar. And then there&#39;s Akshaye Khanna, legend is the only word that fits that man. He&#39;s Bollywood&#39;s secret weapon: used sparingly, but every time he appears, he elevates the entire film. His presence alone adds weight and credibility.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is equally strong, with every role feeling thoughtfully cast and well performed.

Dhurandhar is a must watch for everyone..","I went expecting another spy thriller from Bollywood with over the top action scenes and aura and hype moments, but what I saw on the screen just blew me away.. This film is not like your average Bollywood big budget film where there are slow mo shirtless shots or stupid one liners but this is the best historical spy thriller ever came out of bollywood which is shockingly very real.. I was surprised by the performances of this film, after many years it felt like I&#39;m watching a film of a bollywood actor instead of a bollywood star.. Calm and calculating , Ranveer Singh delivered one of the best performances of his career. But all the praise should go to the Akshay Khanna as Rehman Dacoit he stole the every scene he was in and actually managed to outshadow the main star of this movie, he delivered the greatest performance of his career without any doubt.. Rest of the cast like Sanjay Dutt and Arjun Rampal was great too but I won&#39;t go further into it.. Talking about historical accuracy this film showed us the real face of terrorism and it also included the real clips and recordings of some most famous terrorist attacks happened in India and those scenes actually hits very hard, on other hand it showed us the most realistic deception of our neighborhood country which no Indian film has never shown before... Watch it and you&#39;ll realise it. Talking about technical aspects sometimes films feel too long but some great performances and a realistic story keep things interesting for the audience and it actually sets up the stage for the next half story in the second part, also this film is mostly based on real world events so filmmakers tried to show everything surrounding these events.. But some cringe scenes should&#39;ve been removed and overusing of vulgar language should&#39;ve been toned down too.. Don&#39;t go with thinking about an full blown action movie sure there are some action scenes and especially the final fight scene during the climax which will give the action fans what they want, but action is only here to serve the story instead of vise versa like a typical Bollywood film which is i truly loved about this film, but whatever is shown is raw and very brutal which feels real also most of the action related things are saved for the next part.. At last without saying any spoilers i will say again that Dhurandhar is a must watch for the fans of Spy thrillers and also it is one of the most important and impactful movies I&#39;ve seen from Bollywood in a long time. This is how a real Spy film should be made, instead of showing terrorists as sympathic figures and allies of Indian Spies as in YRF spy universe Dhurandhar showed us the real face of terrorism..

rw11050352,mobashir_rahman,,"Great Characters. Great looks. Story is intriguing. Action scenes are filmsy at best, stupid at worse. And all the propaganda is even worse.","Dhurandhar is, at its core, a strong drama film with a compelling premise. The plot is ambitious and gripping, delivering a brutal spy thriller that does not shy away from R-rated violence. When the film works, it is genuinely intense-often shocking-and succeeds in creating a dark, unsettling atmosphere that keeps the viewer engaged.<br/><br/>One of the film&#39;s greatest strengths is its character development. The story of an Indian prisoner on death row being recruited by Indian authorities to infiltrate the Pakistani mafia is both morally complex and dramatically rich, and the film takes its time building this arc effectively. Ranbir Kapoor (or Ranbheer, as commonly referred to) convincingly embodies a battle-hardened Baloch spy-physically brutal, emotionally scarred, and psychologically convincing. His performance anchors the film and gives weight to the narrative.<br/><br/>The antagonists are equally well-realized. Akshaye Khanna&#39;s portrayal of Dacoit Rehman is particularly chilling. A man who murdered his own mother at the age of fifteen, Rehman is depicted as someone capable of a level of violence that goes far beyond normal human comprehension. Khanna brings a cold, restrained menace to the role, making Rehman feel genuinely dangerous rather than theatrically evil. Arjun Rampal also delivers a strong performance as a shrewd Pakistani intelligence officer, adding another layer of tension and strategic complexity to the story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many of these strengths are undermined by consistently weak action sequences. The action often feels random, poorly staged, and narratively incoherent. Scenes such as people casually opening fire to kill Rehman&#39;s son lack emotional grounding or logical buildup. The escape sequence involving Hamza and his partner is unintentionally laughable, draining tension instead of heightening it. Even the final killing of Rehman-a moment that should have been climactic and devastating-feels oddly flat and underwhelming. These issues are not isolated but symptomatic of Bollywood&#39;s long-standing struggle with believable, well-choreographed action.<br/><br/>More troubling than the action, however, is the film&#39;s overt ideological messaging. Beneath the surface, Dhurandhar strongly suggests that the previous secular Indian government was corrupt, weak, and unpatriotic, while implicitly aligning itself with the worldview promoted under the current ultra-nationalist, ultra-religious Modi government. Given the political climate, it is difficult to ignore the incentives to advance such narratives-particularly those that delegitimize Congress while reinforcing a nationalist moral framework.<br/><br/>The film claims to be fictional, yet it deliberately invokes real, sensitive terrorist attacks on Indian soil and even incorporates real audio tapes from actual events. This selective &quot;fictionalization&quot; feels disingenuous. Rather than serving the story, it functions as a tool to stoke fear, reinforce the idea of a perpetual external enemy, and subtly normalize suspicion toward India&#39;s Muslim minority. In this sense, the propaganda is not just heavy-handed-it is ethically troubling, using cinematic spectacle to legitimize political narratives and social pressure.<br/><br/>In the end, Dhurandhar is a film full of contradictions: strong performances, an intriguing plot, and impressive brutality weighed down by weak action execution and deeply problematic ideological messaging. What could have been a powerful, morally complex spy drama instead becomes a film that entertains, disturbs, and frustrates in equal measure.",0,

The director says the movie is fictional, but the entire film uses footage from real events, and the story clearly mirrors real incidents.

The story follows a man trapped between loyalty, revenge and his own moral boundaries. The plot feels familiar at times, but the film keeps you engaged with its steady pace and a few solid twists.<br/><br/>The lead performance is the real highlight. The actor carries the film with confidence and brings weight to the emotional scenes. The supporting cast does a decent job, although some characters could have been written with more depth.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well-shot and pack good energy. The background score lifts many moments and gives the film a stylish feel. On the other side, the screenplay dips in the middle and a few scenes stretch longer than needed. A bit more polish in the writing would have made the experience tighter.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a watchable entertainer with strong moments, good action and a committed lead performance.

rw11013216,vimarshmunsif,,Dhurandar:- A Long And Engaging Bollywood Flick After A Long Time,"/Dhurandar:- A Long And Engaging Bollywood Flick After A Long Time/<br/><br/>Amidst the ever reducing attention span of human beings, and the constant urge to chop and change, to do multi-tasking all the time, watching long movies has become almost obsolete. Even the makers have noticed this change of guard and are not indulging in making long flicks. Thus, knowing beforehand that Dhurandhar was a long movie made me a tad bit sceptical. But still, as has been the norm of late, I didn&#39;t watch the trailer and was keenly looking forward to watch the movie on the big screen.<br/><br/>The presentation of chapter wise progression was different and unique. It enabled succession and gradual movement of the plot towards its ultimate destination.<br/><br/>For a long time now, Bollywood has become propaganda driven and tilted history in the name of showing new reality or hidden reality. Thus, believing stuff has become difficult. Hence, for this movie, I went with a clear mindset of only watching it as a movie. It helped in staying put throughout without seemingly reaching to any sort of conclusion or judgements.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a typical Bollywood masala flick, comprising of all the relevant ingredients required for providing entertainment and content. It has a lot of violence, set-up, strategising, deceits, suspense, thrill, action and some songs too. The chapters are well compiled, with the perfect Bollywood touch, making for a delightful experience of watching the movie on the big screen.<br/><br/>The length of the movie is 3 hours 32 minutes with the first half being over 2 hours long. Some of the Bollywood movies these days end by the time this movie&#39;s first half got over. I had no issues with the length of the movie though. Yes, some scenes could surely have been removed or shortened, but never did it feel like the movie was boring in parts. There was always some twist, some new plot, some new character, that brought excitement and the urge to know what&#39;s next as such.<br/><br/>What I find amusing every time I watch a Bollywood movie is the writing of the fight sequences. Please make it believable man! Too much cinematic liberty spoils the fun. I would suggest the makers to hire some WWE script writers to officially write proper fight sequences for Bollywood movies, so that they can seem a tad bit believable too.<br/><br/>The writing and direction by Aditya Dhar was engaging and compelling. The chapter wise setup made it feel like a long web series being shown on the big screen. Again, just like the web series&#39;, the ending left a lot to be desired. We would have to cling on to what next now to see where it all ends. There was a big disclaimer in the beginning of the movie, which felt a bit too much. Some real life clips were slipped in amidst the written script, to boast the movie watching experience. Still, the kind of intense buildup which the first half had, I expected it to go up a notch in the second half. But the film fell flat instead.<br/><br/>The casting by Mukesh Chhabra was brilliant. I would point out on some amazing picks later. The ensemble cast together did a really good job. The look, the get up, were all outstanding too.<br/><br/>Cinematography by Vikash Nowlakha was good. The colours used, a nice blend of dark and light, the frames captured, some really close and difficult for the eyes, were all terrific.<br/><br/>I don&#39;t know if editing was bad or needed polishing coz I didn&#39;t feel bored. Yes, the second half should have been more intense and some scenes could have been removed or cut short. But I would say that Shivkumar V. Panicker has done an average job as an editor for this movie.<br/><br/>The dialogues were heavy, with abuses being hurled for fun too. There were adult dialogues aplenty. There were some over the top Urdu dialogues too, which gave a good listening without much understanding!<br/><br/>The music of the film was composed by Shashwat Sachdev. I felt the music was decent, given the dreadful quality of it these days. Nothing outstanding, but still, quite okay.<br/><br/>However, the film has used so many of the yesteryear gems. I don&#39;t know if enough credits were given to the original makers or not. But songs like Chupke Chupke Raat Din, Ramba Ho, Om Shanti Om, remix version of Monica Oh My Darling, Piya Tu Ab To Aaja, Hawa Hawa and Dum Maaro Dum were used big time in the movie. Again, it just shows how they ain&#39;t able to make proper music and have to go back to the old gems for survival. Surely, these gems added to the plus points of the movie.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, I have never been a fan of Ranveer Singh. I have only liked his performance in Lootera. However, he has done a really good job here. He hasn&#39;t gone overboard this time. A bit bulky, with long hair, looking a tad bit like Ishant Sharma, he stuck to his role and did a decent job.<br/><br/>The look of R Madhavan was outstanding. He spoke his dialogues brilliantly and showed some emotions perfectly too.<br/><br/>Akshay Khanna was good too. He had that constant look and persona that defined him. Also, I loved the couple of instances wherein he danced a bit, especially the dance sequence in Balochistan, with the Valla Valla and marshmallow song.<br/><br/>Chapter 5 was titled Jinn and the way the Chapter 4 had ended, I surely knew it was time for Sanju Baba to arrive. There&#39;s an aura of awesomeness that governs Sanjay Dutt. I just loved his screen presence. They had mentioned &quot;Special Appearance&quot; in his name but I didn&#39;t feel like it was such a role. He was an integral part of the movie.<br/><br/>Danish Pandor had a big role and he did a really good job. I loved his performance. Rakesh Bedi was in a pivotal role and he delivered a great performance too. Arjun Rampal had a good role and he surely made an impact too.<br/><br/>Saumya Tandon came in as a surprise in the movie and it was good to see her again on the big screen. Also, the girl Sara Arjun impressed with her looks and dialogue delivery.<br/><br/>Now, lemme focus on the 3 best performances in the movie for me. First, it was an absolute delight to see Akash Khurana in a role in the movie. He&#39;s still got it and his look was really good too. I&#39;ve been a fan of Naveen Kaushik since Rocket Singh days. He was outstanding as Donga here, as the loyal servant. Such a phenomenal performance from him it was. He has also become a bit bulky now.<br/><br/>And now, guess what, the best performance for me was that of Gaurav Gera, as Mohammad Aalam. Remember him, yeah! It is difficult to even recognise him but what a sheer class performance it was from him! I totally didn&#39;t expect him and was pleasantly surprised with both seeing him and also him delivering an excellent performance overall.<br/><br/>All in all, there&#39;s a lot of violence, action, fights and revenge in the movie. The efforts that have gone into making the looks of the cast is commendable.<br/><br/>Also, some chapters started and ended. However, there&#39;s still more to come from how things unfolded in the end.<br/><br/>Thus, Dhurandhar was a long but an engaging movie. The first half was incredible. Comparatively, the second half left a bit more to be desired. The usage of old songs felt bad but added so much to the flavour of the movie.<br/><br/>I would rate the movie 3.5/5.",0,

The brutal, visceral hand-to-hand combat and realistic set pieces enhance the film&#39;s raw feel. The action sequence in Chapter 3 is terrific and well-choreographed!<br/><br/>Immersive World-Building: The film excels at creating an authentic sense of place, transforming locations in India and Thailand into the dense, chaotic alleys of Karachi&#39;s Lyari district.<br/><br/>The cinematography uses muted tones and shadows to create a dark, gritty, and tense atmosphere.<br/><br/>The background score is relentless. The use of real audio recordings from the 26/11 Mumbai attacks is chilling and impactful, connecting fiction to a real tragedy.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast is the film&#39;s greatest strength, with every actor delivering powerful performances.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna Ji is the film&#39;s soul and scene-stealer. His portrayal of the complex, charismatic, and chilling gangster Rehman Dakait (~based on Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch) is laudable for its depth and menace. A sureshot contender for the National Award.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh churns out a restrained and intense performance, a departure from his usual energetic roles. He effectively embodies the quiet determination and inner conflict of an undercover agent, letting subtle gestures speak volumes. His character Hamza Ali Mazari/Jaskirat Singh Rangi is a composite of multiple Indian Para Special Forces (Para SF) and Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW) operatives who have conducted covert operations.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt, Rakesh Bedi and Arjun Rampal all make significant impacts ensuring there are no weak links in the cast.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan&#39;s character, Ajay Sanyal, is inspired by India&#39;s current National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt&#39;s character SP Chaudhary Aslam is inspired by the real Chaudhry Aslam Khan, a renowned Pakistani &quot;encounter specialist&quot; police officer who targeted and eliminated many major criminals, including Rehman Baloch.<br/><br/>Rakesh Bedi&#39;s character Jameel Jamali is inspired by the real-life Pakistani politician Nabil Gabol.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal as Major Iqbal is modelled after Ilyas Kashmiri, a dangerous Pakistani ex-Special Forces operative who became a high-ranking Al-Qaeda commander linked to major terror attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.<br/><br/>The film weaves these real-life figures and events into a fictional narrative centered around a large-scale covert operation in Karachi&#39;s Lyari district, known as &quot;Operation Lyari&quot;.<br/><br/>This film will be talked about for many years for its strong performances, gritty direction, and intense, grounded action.<br/><br/>Fact-checkers and critics will cry factual inaccuracies in the film. Just ignore! Propaganda accusations? None. Don&#39;t trust the negative reviews!<br/><br/>The sheer volume of information and characters may overwhelm the audience. (information overload)
But, if you loved Black Friday (2004), trust me Dhurandhar is much more and beyond.<br/><br/>This is an example of how a two-part film must be treated. Can&#39;t wait for the Part-2 of this film March 2026.",0,

rw11023769,shivamsemwal,,Engaging but Excessive,"Dhurandhar positions itself as a large-scale spy thriller inspired by real events, and from a technical standpoint, it does several things right. The background score, sound design, and overall audio treatment effectively build tension and add to the thriller atmosphere. Viewed purely as a genre film, it is engaging and works reasonably well.<br/><br/>However, the film relies more on emotional amplification than on strong storytelling. Instead of letting the narrative and characters naturally drive the impact, it often turns to exaggerated dramatic moments, heavy-handed dialogues, and repeated emphasis on familiar conflict themes. This comes across as an attempt to compensate for a weaker script rather than a confident storytelling choice.<br/><br/>The use of real-life footage and audio clips from past terrorist attacks adds shock value, but it feels excessive and avoidable in many places. Similarly, the level of on-screen violence and gore is pushed far beyond what the story actually demands. Rather than increasing tension, the excessive gore often feels like it is there purely for effect, reducing its overall impact.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from its length. At close to three and a half hours, Dhurandhar noticeably drags, and a tighter edit would have made the experience far more effective without sacrificing key moments.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a decent one-time watch if approached strictly as a spy thriller with strong technical execution. That said, its overreliance on heightened emotions, excessive violence, and overstated themes prevents it from becoming a sharper and more refined film. A more restrained approach and a stronger script could have elevated it significantly.",0,

The whole casting is god-tier with every single actor giving a terrific performance. And Ranveer Singh...the man that you are 🙇‍♀️ This is the comeback that he deserved. He once again proved why he is such a powerful actor who could do wonders when given the right movie. He had this nuance, raw and visceral way of expressing himself that felt realistic and not cheap at all. He acted like an actual spy would. The action scenes were gory and gritty in the best way possible, with superb action choreography that didn&#39;t involve the quintessential Bollywood style action which involves nonsensical drama and heroism. The music was fire and creative, with the whole album being an absolute banger. The set, costume design and makeup was spot on. I could honestly go on and on about how good every element of this movie was but then we would be here all night.<br/><br/>All I have to say is that India was hungry for a movie like this. The sheer agony and anger that this country holds for centuries, from countless terrorist attacks and havoc caused by Pakistan, has finally been shown in cinema. Indians won&#39;t tolerate any more sugar coating and glazing of Pakistan and terrorist sympathisers, and will rise stronger like a tiger who doesn&#39;t back down from taking revenge.

The movie opens with a shlok from the Bhagavad Gita, instantly setting a profound and intense tone-something rarely seen and deeply effective.<br/><br/>What truly stands out is the direction and the bold choice of background music. The way songs are placed during crucial scenes is simply unbelievable. No one would imagine playing &quot;Loot Le Gaya&quot; during an election candidature announcement, yet it worked brilliantly. Similarly, using the Dhurandhar title track during the car fight sequence elevates the scene to another level. These creative risks make the audience go &quot;wow&quot; repeatedly.<br/><br/>Beyond the cinematic brilliance, the film courageously showcases the harsh realities of heinous terror attacks in India by Napak and highlights the importance and impact of demonetization-handled with clarity and conviction.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is not just a movie; it&#39;s an experience that blends storytelling, music, and realism with purpose.<br/><br/>A must-watch for each and every Indian. 🇮🇳",0,
rw11053099,sandybindass-24445,,A Realistic Spy Thriller That Redefines the Genre,"The action scenes are amazing. The intention behind these scenes was to show cruelty, and they succeed in doing so very effectively. The screen time given to each actor is perfectly balanced and according to the requirement of the story. The dialogues are beautifully written.<br/><br/>A spy movie should not be overly heroic; instead, it should feel real-like a true mole story that makes the audience feel the fear of being caught and the terror of punishment. This movie serves that purpose very well. The collections are impressive, especially considering that the movie was banned in Gulf countries, from where a major portion of overseas collections usually comes.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar has changed the dynamics of the spy movie genre. This will be a real challenge for YRF Productions in the future.<br/><br/>Another beautiful aspect of the movie is its songs. You hardly feel like you are listening to songs; instead, they feel like a continuation of the story the director wants to narrate. The songs play a vital role-without them, the movie would feel incomplete. Kudos to the music director for composing/recomposing such beautiful tracks and to the director for using them at the right moments.<br/><br/>The promotions of this movie were minimal. Only word of mouth worked, and I believe this is how it should be for all movies. If a movie is good, no negative hate can stop it. Dhruv Rathee tried hard to defame it and portrayed it as propaganda, similar to a Vivek Agnihotri movie, but he did not succeed.<br/><br/>Therefore, this movie is a perfect example for filmmakers: focus on making a good product. Don&#39;t worry about promotions or negative criticism. If your product is good, word of mouth will help fill the seats.<br/><br/>#Pacifistsandeep.",1,

rw11015824,ReelMysterySeeker,,"A Gritty Beast of a Film - Raw, Relentless & Intensely Engaging","Dhurandhar is not just another Bollywood thriller; it is a heavy, unfiltered experience that grips you from the first act and refuses to let go. Set against the backdrop of crime, espionage, and political tension, the film dives deep into the underworld with courage and ambition. What stands out immediately is how unapologetically gritty it is - no sugar-coating, no restraint, just pure high-voltage storytelling.<br/><br/>The performances are a major driving force here. Ranveer Singh delivers one of his most layered roles in recent times, balancing aggression, conflict, and vulnerability with finesse. Akshaye Khanna, calm but dangerously compelling, steals scenes without effort. Supporting actors like R. Madhavan and Sanjay Dutt bring their own weight to the narrative, making the film feel rich in character and presence. Each face on-screen adds to the story rather than just filling space.<br/><br/>Cinematography and sound design elevate the tension - dimly lit alleys, chaotic shootouts, and atmospheric background score create a world you can feel. However, Dhurandhar isn&#39;t a light watch. At nearly three and a half hours, the length is noticeable. The story is loaded with subplots, violence, and emotional weight, which may overwhelm viewers who prefer tighter or softer films. But for those who appreciate bold storytelling, the runtime serves as immersion rather than drag.<br/><br/>What makes Dhurandhar memorable is not just the action, but the emotion beneath it - loyalty, sacrifice, betrayal, and the cost of power. It leaves you thinking, even after credits roll.<br/><br/>A long, intense, and hard-hitting film - not perfect, but undeniably impactful.",0,

This kind of movie transcends mere entertainment; it becomes a vital document, a mirror reflecting a nation&#39;s soul, its complexities, and its often-uncomfortable realities.

rw11001418,newtonbon,,Dhurandhar is a film,"Dhurandhar is a film that seems ambitious on the surface, but the moment it begins, it becomes clear that the execution is far from effective. The story lacks originality and feels like a collection of familiar plotlines seen many times before. There is no real novelty, no surprise element, and no emotional depth that keeps the audience hooked. The narrative moves at a frustratingly slow pace, dragging through scene after scene without meaningful progress.<br/><br/>The characters feel hollow due to poor writing. The protagonist doesn&#39;t have a strong personality or compelling motivation. His emotional journey is inconsistent, and his reactions often feel misplaced. The supporting characters exist only for the sake of filling space and do not contribute meaningfully to the storyline. Even the villain lacks presence, making the conflict feel weak and unexciting.<br/><br/>The direction lacks clarity and confidence. Many scenes feel stretched without purpose, while others feel rushed and unfinished. Emotional scenes fail to connect, action scenes lack intensity, and dramatic scenes feel over-performed. The film struggles to maintain the audience&#39;s attention because it doesn&#39;t offer any memorable or engaging moment.<br/><br/>Technical aspects also fall short. The cinematography feels flat and uninspiring, with very few visually interesting shots. The editing is sloppy, causing abrupt scene transitions that break the flow. The background music feels repetitive and often fails to match the tone of the scene.<br/><br/>By the time the movie reaches its climax, the audience is already exhausted. The conclusion feels weak and unearned, leaving viewers unsatisfied. The film attempts to end with an emotional resolution, but since the journey itself lacked emotional weight, the final scene also feels meaningless.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a disappointing film with weak writing, poor direction, dull performances, and slow pacing. It lacks the energy and emotional impact needed to make it memorable. It&#39;s not a movie I would recommend to anyone looking for a strong or engaging cinematic experience.",9,
rw11011368,twinkle-04212,,"Dhurandhar: Intense, Unfiltered, and Worth Every Minute","Genuinely enjoyed watching Dhurandhar. Even though it&#39;s a lengthy film, not a single minute felt wasted. The narrative is gripping, the performances are solid, and the film keeps you hooked with its intensity and realism.<br/><br/>One of the most impactful aspects of the movie is how boldly and accurately it portrays Pakistan, its terror outfits, and their deep nexus with criminal gangs operating across the border. The film doesn&#39;t shy away from exposing the machinery behind terror-how handlers, networks, and gangs operate as one coordinated system. It presents this dark reality without exaggeration, and that honesty hits hard.<br/><br/>But the moment that shook me the most was the 26/11 sequence. Hearing the actual recorded conversation between the terrorist and his handler sent chills down my spine. It was unsettling, infuriating, and emotional all at once. That scene alone reminds you why such stories need to be told-so we don&#39;t forget what happened and what still threatens us.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is more than just a film-it&#39;s an experience. Intense, revealing, thought-provoking, and absolutely worth your time. I walked out feeling both impressed and deeply moved.",0,

Bollywood is so back.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is not just a movie, it&#39;s an experience that slowly grips you and refuses to let go. From the very first frame, the film pulls you into a dark, intense world where silence speaks louder than dialogues and every look carries weight. The storytelling is raw, layered, and unapologetically bold.<br/><br/>The performances are the backbone of this film. Each character feels lived-in, especially the ones walking the thin line between right and wrong. There are no easy heroes here-only humans shaped by circumstances. The emotions feel real, sometimes uncomfortable, and that&#39;s exactly what makes Dhurandhar stand out. You don&#39;t just watch the characters; you feel their struggles, their rage, and their quiet moments of vulnerability.<br/><br/>The direction deserves special mention. The pacing is deliberate, allowing scenes to breathe and tensions to build naturally. The background score subtly enhances the mood without overpowering the narrative, and the cinematography captures the grit and intensity perfectly. Every frame feels purposeful, adding depth to the story rather than just looking visually appealing.<br/><br/>What truly makes Dhurandhar memorable is its ability to stay with you even after the credits roll. It makes you think-about choices, consequences, and the price one pays for power and survival. The film doesn&#39;t spoon-feed answers; instead, it trusts the audience to interpret, question, and reflect.<br/><br/>In an era of loud and predictable cinema, Dhurandhar chooses to be different. It&#39;s brave, thought-provoking, and emotionally heavy in the best way possible. This is the kind of film that grows on you with time, leaving an impact that doesn&#39;t fade easily.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is cinema that demands attention-and rewards it fully.",0,

rw11015846,ShikhaB-082,,Rekindled my love for cinema,"Where shall I begin? I loved and enjoyed this movie thoroughly. This movie rekindled my love for action movies again and took me once again to theatres after many years. This is the film I wanted for so long. This is an excellent well made movie without having over the top action and is grounded in reality driven by a compelling storyline and good acting which is not the case with action movies these days which are just massy and over the top action. Don&#39;t get me wrong I like massy film but I think india has stretched it too far. Even if I put aside this fact this film is good by its own merit. The characters drives the story forward and are so impactful. I know everybody is gasping about Akshay Khanna&#39;s character, yes sure he has done an exceptional job with his character and is very impactful throughout the film but I loved and deeply resonated with Ranveer Singh&#39;s character. His eyes did all the work, he barely had any dialogues in the film. I connected with him instantly with the opening song &quot;na karwan ki talash na humsafar ki talash hai&quot;. This sets the characters motivation so perfectly and to see the pain and hardship his character goes through makes you realise what the people in this work go through in real life to protect this nation. Ranveer Singh&#39;s character is so small and purposefully so and yet so impactful. Especially the scene of 26 11, I literally cried reminiscing of what a horror it was back in the day. It was conveyed from the perspective of ranveer singh so beautifully that you feel all his helplessness and pain. The fact that the horror of the reality is front of him and he s shocked and hyperventilating but he cannot react in that moment. His character deeply touched me because I think the people who only exist just to protect a nation sacrificing everything that life could offer, choosing hardship for others, truly are the most noble people on this planet. I think that&#39;s the highest form of love that the person is capable of. I could feel the emptiness and holoness of his character and yet I could feel his pure sense of love for his nation. It is great acting. Sanjay Dutt&#39;s character was fun and the conflict and face off between Akshay Khanna&#39;s character and his was truly a delight to me. It was entertaining to the core. Sanjay Dutt&#39;s madness and his self driven motivation to kill Akshay Khanna&#39;s character was pure entertainment. This movie was so much more on the deep level than just on the surface is what makes it an outstanding piece of art. Aditya dhar has given us yet again another film which we all indians can be proud of.",0,
rw11011216,borkarfaiz,,"Akshaye Khanna Shines, the Film Doesn't","Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t divide people by country; it divides them by religion.

It ends up feeling more like a propaganda piece than a genuine thriller. Apart from Akshaye Khanna&#39;s acting, there&#39;s nothing here worth holding on to. If you enjoy violent action, the movie has some of that, but I&#39;m not a fan of that style anyway. For me, the whole experience falls flat.",2,

In my defense, I hadn&#39;t known that it was directed (as well as written and produced) by Aditya Dhar, who is turning into someone who is the equivalent of Michael Bay in Bollywood. He has found his niche. Taut spy thrillers.<br/><br/>This has a long timeline with events starting from the IC-814 Kandahar hijacking and presumably to the present day. I don&#39;t know if I should mention it or if it is a spoiler, the movie has a part 2 coming out in March where the premise ties up all the loose ends.<br/><br/>With a brilliant and very capable cast, who played every role very well, this has been written very well. There has been some jumps and connections made which will escape audience members who aren&#39;t well versed in world events. They will find it difficult to understand but the whole screenplay was executed so well. And I wholeheartedly agree that a part 2 was absolutely necessary because of the long timeline and bringing the resolution of so many characters. And I look forward to it eagerly.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, Ranveer Singh, R Madhavan and good ole Sanju baba are excellent and the side cast who play a myriad of characters do a fantastic job. That is what makes it so good...<br/><br/>I think a thriller loving audience will enjoy it and it is NOT for rom-com lovers and fans of family dramas. I might even have a second visit. My wife had refused to go thinking it will be a boys dishum-dishum kind of film but now she wants to go hearing me rave about it. Go figure!!",0,
rw11012073,PradeepN-86,,Must watch movie,"I don&#39;t why this is movie is getting hate if you are 18+ you should must watch it. Dhurandhar, directed by Aditya Dhar, stands out as a sharp, high-intensity thriller that blends emotional depth with a gripping narrative. Dhar, known for his command over storytelling and atmosphere, takes a bold leap with this film, delivering a story that feels both grounded and larger-than-life. What makes Dhurandhar compelling is its ability to maintain suspense while exploring themes of morality, power, and human resilience.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s strength lies in its layered writing. Dhar constructs a narrative that keeps the audience guessing at every turn-revealing just enough to pull you deeper into the mystery without ever giving away too much. The pacing is tight, the conflicts feel authentic, and the twists arrive at just the right moments. Every scene is crafted with intention, and the buildup pays off effectively in the final act.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, the cast elevates the film. The lead protagonist delivers a nuanced, emotionally rich performance, portraying inner conflict and determination with striking clarity. The antagonist is equally fascinating-charismatic, calculated, and terrifying in a quiet, restrained way that makes him unforgettable. Their face-offs form the emotional and dramatic core of the movie.<br/><br/>Visually, Dhurandhar is stunning. The cinematography makes clever use of shadows, color palettes, and scale to heighten tension. The action sequences are well-choreographed-stylish yet realistic-and the background score amplifies the suspense without overpowering the storytelling.<br/><br/>What sets Dhurandhar apart is Dhar&#39;s ability to balance intensity with meaning. The film never feels like a mindless thriller; it carries emotional weight and raises thoughtful questions about justice, truth, and the cost of doing what is right.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a powerful, immersive thriller that showcases Aditya Dhar&#39;s mastery as a filmmaker.

rw11015865,keshavbansll,,A Different Kind of Chess Game.,"Exceptional filmmaking with precise direction and quality performances by all the actors.<br/><br/>Instead of a typical &quot;Hero vs Villain&quot; template, it rolls out like a twisted chess game. We have two players, India and Pakistan, playing against each other. But there are multiple assets and players from each team. Some are playing along, some are having their own game. No team among both is perfect among themselves as well. Remember &quot;Siyaasat mein koi sagaa nahi hota&quot;.<br/><br/>This is nearly perfect for its genre. An espionage thriller film that does not lean heavily on action to create massy moments.<br/><br/>The Main Protagonist is overshadowed by an antagonist in 80% of the film!! This is a good thing when you have to show your hero as an undercover agent.<br/><br/>The action was not disgusting. It was real. It was brutal where it had to be. It was raw where it had to be. Politics plays a major role, but it never feels boring.<br/><br/>AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING - It does not feel repetitive. Bollywood has produced numerous content on the Ind vs Pak formula, but this is not the same. It shows internal gang wars, connections, struggles, a story told from a different perspective, from a grounded perspective of a person on the other side of the border.",0,

The story grips you from the start and rarely loosens its hold.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers an intense performance and looks convincing in Pathani suits as a Baloch character, thanks to his muscular build and height.<br/><br/>A pleasant surprise in the film is Rakesh Bedi. Known mostly for comic sidekick roles, he shines here as a cunning politician. Full credit to the casting director for this unexpected yet effective choice.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt plays a character that suits his persona perfectly.<br/><br/>But the highlight of the movie is undoubtedly Akshay Khanna. We always knew he was a brilliant actor, but here his brilliance dominates the screen. After Chhava, this film becomes another milestone where he fully lives the character.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal&#39;s character seems underdeveloped for now-almost as if he walked straight from the sets of Rana Naidu Season 2. Not very impressive, but his arc will likely build in the next chapter.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan is impactful in a short role and bears a striking resemblance to Ajit Doval-credit to the makeup team.<br/><br/>Sara Arjun looks beautiful and shows immense promise; she definitely has a bright career ahead.<br/><br/>The script is tight and engaging, but one noticeable drawback is the accent work. The accents do not resemble Karachi&#39;s Baloch or local dialects; they should have invested more effort here.<br/><br/>Overall, it&#39;s a beautifully made movie with great performances, and the sequel will surely be even more intense.<br/><br/>However, I personally did not like the part involving an Indian handler supplying ammunition to terrorists, especially those responsible for massacres in India.<br/><br/>A message to the screenplay writer: Sir, we don&#39;t need this type of twist - real or fictional.

rw11023737,mikhilsaluja,,Trying too hard to be cool,"Dhurandhar has a promising premise but collapses under the weight of its own styling.<br/><br/>The chapter structure is the first giveaway. Chapters arrive without narrative purpose. There&#39;s no shift in perspective, no temporal leap, no thematic transition. It&#39;s often just the same scene continuing under a new title. For an otherwise linear story, the excessive chaptering feels like borrowed grammar from auteur cinema, without understanding why that grammar exists. It&#39;s form for the sake of form.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh&#39;s performance is equally puzzling. His voice is pushed into an exaggerated baritone, unnaturally gruff throughout, to the point where it feels imposed rather than organic. Instead of adding gravitas, it distances the character from any emotional credibility.<br/><br/>The music is where the film truly unravels. There is no musical language, only a playlist. Folk, Indian classical, guitar-heavy rock, rap, old Hindi film music, Arabic textures, and then suddenly American jazz playing during a casual evening scene in Pakistan. The transitions are abrupt and unmotivated. It feels less like a score evolving with the narrative and more like the filmmakers trying to justify the rights they purchased. Compare this to a well-made Hollywood action film, where the score may evolve but still feels like it belongs to one world, one story. Here, every genre is fighting for attention.<br/><br/>The action sequences are styled to look &quot;cool&quot; rather than feel real. Slow-motion entries, loud needle drops, stylised gunplay, bodies flying with visibly poor CGI. Physics is treated as optional. Indian mainstream cinema still struggles with action that respects weight, impact, and consequence, and Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t break that pattern.<br/><br/>Narratively, key emotional beats are rushed or mishandled. Akshay&#39;s son&#39;s death, for instance, is treated with startling superficiality. There&#39;s no real inquiry into how it happened, no emotional processing, no investigative weight. Instead, the film jumps straight into formalities, interviews, rewards, and exposition-heavy dialogue that conveniently pushes Ranveer into the next plot role. It feels mechanical, like ticking story boxes rather than telling a story.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film is obsessed with looking suave. Every moment is engineered for swagger. Loud music, slow motion, stylised violence, cool poses. But none of it feels grounded. The irony is that the core premise is strong. With restraint, coherence, and emotional discipline, it could have worked. Instead, the execution leans heavily into a glossy, Rohit Shetty-esque spectacle that mistakes noise for impact.<br/><br/>Style overwhelms substance. And the film never recovers from that imbalance.",1,
rw11010711,AVNEESHK-523,,A brutally realistic spy film,"A unflinching spy thriller that portrays the Pakistan-sponsored terrorism with gritty realism. Its rough, documentary-style approach makes every scene tense and unsettling. A stark, compelling watch that refuses to sugarcoat the world of covert conflict.<br/><br/>This spy thriller stands out for its unfiltered, unpolished look at a world usually dressed up with glamour. Instead of slick action sequences and invincible agents, the film delivers a tense, ground-level view of espionage and conflict. What makes it especially gripping is its fictional portrayal of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, shown not through dramatic exaggeration but through small, chilling details that make the story feel disturbingly plausible within its narrative universe.<br/><br/>From the first scene, the film throws the audience into a world where chaos is routine, trust is scarce, and survival depends on decisions made in split seconds. The cinematography is intentionally rough-handheld shots, muted colors, and unsteady close-ups that make you feel like you&#39;re right there with the characters, breathing the same dusty air and absorbing the same fear.

Directed by Aditya Dhar (the mastermind behind Uri: The Surgical Strike), this film isn&#39;t just a movie; it&#39;s a visceral, high-octane experience that reminds us why we love the big screen.<br/><br/>Here is why Dhurandhar is an absolute must-watch:
1. Ranveer Singh Like Never Before
Ranveer sheds his usual flamboyant energy to deliver a performance of simmering intensity. As Hamza, an undercover intelligence agent infiltrating the hostile underworld of Karachi, he is restrained, gritty, and explosive. His transformation, both physical and emotional,into a man living on a razor&#39;s edge is arguably one of the finest of his career. You don&#39;t just watch him; you fear for him.<br/><br/>2. The &quot;Apex Predator&quot; ,Akshaye Khanna
Every great hero needs a terrifying villain, and Akshaye Khanna steals the show as Rehman Dakait. His portrayal of a menacing crime lord is chilling. The psychological cat-and-mouse game between him and Ranveer is the heartbeat of the film. Their face-offs are not just about punches; they are masterclasses in acting.<br/><br/>3. A Stellar Ensemble Cast
The supporting cast is a dream team. R. Madhavan brings quiet authority as the intelligence strategist, Arjun Rampal is formidable as the ISI adversary Major Iqbal, and Sanjay Dutt adds raw power as SP Chaudhary Aslam. It&#39;s rare to see so many heavyweights sharing the screen, and each one gets a moment to shine.<br/><br/>4. The Scale and Action
Aditya Dhar has crafted a world that feels dangerous and real. The action sequences,especially the hand-to-hand combat,are raw and brutal, avoiding unnecessary slow-motion for a more grounded impact. The recreation of the gritty Lyari town and the high-stakes espionage operations will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>5. It&#39;s an Epic Saga
Be prepared: this is a massive film (clocking in at over 3 hours), but it uses that time to build a dense, complex story inspired by real geopolitical events. It feels like an epic novel brought to life. Plus, the ending perfectly sets up the confirmed sequel (Part 2 arrives March 2026), leaving you desperate for more.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a masterclass in tension, patriotism, and storytelling. It&#39;s gritty, emotional, and visually stunning. Don&#39;t let the runtime scare you-this is a saga that demands to be witnessed.",0,

It&#39;s a must-watch for its perfectly balanced elements: a great, well-paced story that never drags, and absolutely superb performances from the entire cast. The film also deserves special praise for its amazing action scenes. They feel raw, realistic, and gritty-a refreshing departure from typical Bollywood sequences where a single hero effortlessly takes on a crowd. Here, every punch has weight and every confrontation feels dangerous and consequential.<br/><br/>To top it all off, the songs are not just great; they are fantastically integrated, elevating key moments and making the film&#39;s world feel alive and immersive.

Every frame feels meticulously crafted, from the electrifying action sequences to the emotionally loaded character moments. The lead actor delivers a career-defining performance, carrying the film with charisma, intensity, and surprising vulnerability. The direction is sharp, the pacing relentless, and the background score elevates the narrative into something genuinely cinematic.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is its ability to balance mass entertainment with smart storytelling. The world feels alive, the conflicts feel personal, and even the supporting characters leave a mark. It&#39;s rare to see a film that fires on all cylinders - writing, performances, music, cinematography - and Dhurandhar does exactly that. A must-watch that sets a new benchmark for the genre.",0,
rw11006746,PoojaL-29,,A Storm of Stars and Intense Action,"Audiences are immediately drawn into a world of layered conflict and high stakes.

Ranveer Singh has truly outdone himself-he is energetic, intense, and fully believable in every scene. Sanjay Dutt brings his usual charm and power, while Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan add depth to the story with their brilliant acting. Arjun Rampal stands out in action-packed sequences, and young Sara Arjun is adorable yet impactful. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction keeps the story tight, mixing action, drama, and emotions effortlessly.

rw11009281,dasrumana,,A Realistic Spy Act That Stands Out,"Watched this movie yesterday and didn&#39;t expect this from a mainstream bollywood movie. What impressed me most about Dhurandhar was how Ranveer Singh portrayed the role of a spy with such subtlety and control. Instead of playing it like a typical Bollywood hero who dominates every frame, he truly blended into the story the way a real undercover agent should. His movements, gestures, and expressions were all effective, making his character feel authentic and believable.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is long, but it felt like binge-watching a series-which I generally love-because the pacing and flow kept me hooked throughout.<br/><br/>However, I didn&#39;t particularly like a few of the controversial statements made by R. Madhavan&#39;s character. The pro-government tone in some dialogues felt unnecessary and slightly out of place in an otherwise gripping spy narrative.<br/><br/>Definitely waiting for the second part.

rw11045382,moturiaditya,,Dhurandhar the beast of movie,"Dhurandhar: The Beast is a gritty action-drama that blends raw physical power with deep emotional conflict. The film centers on Dhurandhar, a feared and misunderstood man whose brute strength and violent reputation have earned him the label of a &quot;beast.&quot; Raised in an environment of cruelty, injustice, and survival, Dhurandhar grows into a lone warrior shaped by pain rather than compassion. Society sees him as a monster, but beneath his ferocity lies a man struggling with his humanity.<br/><br/>The story unfolds as Dhurandhar becomes entangled in a corrupt system ruled by ruthless criminals and power-hungry elites. His uncontrollable rage makes him a weapon-used by others or hunted when he refuses to submit. While his actions are often brutal, they are driven by a strong moral instinct to protect the weak and punish oppressors. This internal contradiction-violence versus justice-forms the emotional core of the film.<br/><br/>As the plot progresses, Dhurandhar is forced to confront his past, including betrayals that turned him into what he is. A key relationship-whether with a loved one, mentor, or innocent victim-begins to awaken his suppressed emotions, challenging the idea that he is beyond redemption. The film explores whether a man branded as a beast can reclaim his soul, or if destiny has already sealed his fate.<br/><br/>The climax delivers intense action and emotional resolution as Dhurandhar faces the ultimate choice: embrace the beast within to destroy evil, or sacrifice himself to end the cycle of violence. Dhurandhar: The Beast is ultimately a story about identity, redemption, and the thin line between man and monster, questioning who the real beasts are in a corrupt world.",0,

rw11048744,dixit9,,Movie Review: Dhurandhar - A Masterclass in Gritty Storytelling,"Dhurandhar is not just a movie; it is an immersive experience that commands your attention from the very first frame. Directed by Aditya Dhar, this political spy thriller takes a complex, multi-layered story and simplifies it into a gripping narrative that keeps the audience hooked for over three hours.<br/><br/>The Performance: A Tale of Two Halves
The film&#39;s greatest strength lies in its character arcs.<br/><br/>The First Half (Akshaye Khanna&#39;s Territory): Akshaye Khanna delivers a powerhouse performance that reminds us why he is one of the finest actors in the industry. He centers the movie with a calm yet terrifying intensity.<br/><br/>The Second Half (The Rise of Ranveer Singh): The transition is seamless. As the story evolves, the focus shifts beautifully toward Ranveer Singh. He brings a raw, subdued energy that perfectly balances the earlier chapters, proving his versatility in a more restrained role.<br/><br/>The Supporting Cast: Veteran actors like Rakesh Bedi add significant depth. In a film with so many characters, every role feels essential and meticulously detailed, a testament to Dhar&#39;s vision.<br/><br/>Direction &amp; Craft
Most directors struggle with large ensembles and long runtimes, often losing the thread in the second act. However, Aditya Dhar maintains a &quot;masculine spine&quot; throughout the film. The world-building-recreating the gritty atmosphere of Karachi&#39;s Lyari-is textured and believable.<br/><br/>The Technical Edge
Music: The soundtrack by Shashwat Sachdev is &quot;spot on.&quot; From the high-energy title track to the clever use of 80s and 90s nostalgia, the music acts as a lead character itself, driving the psychological tension of the film.<br/><br/>Impact: This is the kind of cinema that stays with you. It doesn&#39;t rely on over-the-top action but on realistic, grounded confrontation that sparks deep discussion long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Dhurandhar is a &quot;quantum leap&quot; for Indian cinema. It is rare to see a film handle such scale with so much heart and precision.",0,
rw11010018,aritra_jana,,Dhurandhar = Total Mass + Solid Class! Akshaye Khanna just stole the whole show! 🔥🎬,"Dhurandhar is an absolute cinematic blast! The film runs for 3 hours 30 minutes, but not for a single moment does the duration feel stretched - the gripping pace and tight storytelling keep you glued to the seat.<br/><br/>While Ranveer Singh is the official lead and gives a powerful performance, it&#39;s Akshaye Khanna who truly steals the show. His screen presence, dialogue delivery, and layered expressions make every frame he&#39;s in feel electrifying. Arjun Rampal and Sanjay Dutt also deliver brilliant performances, adding depth, style, and menace to the film.<br/><br/>The background music (BGM) deserves a special mention - it elevates every big moment and gives the action sequences a massive adrenaline boost. Speaking of action - it&#39;s massive, raw, and thrilling, with some scenes that will make the audience cheer loud!<br/><br/>The film also touches upon the 26/11 chapter, delivering emotional weight and patriotic fire - moments that hit like a truck and leave your eyes moist.<br/><br/>In short: Great performances
Killer BGM

rw11100645,ranrock-51550,,A nightmarish boring long stunt movie- too bad.,"Watching Dhurandhar in a multiplex, with expectations inflated by relentless media hype and social media noise, turned out to be a thoroughly disappointing experience. The film sinks far below even the formulaic stunt movies of the 1950s and 60s starring N. A. Ansari or Sheikh Mukhtar. What unfolds on screen is an over-imagined, chaotic mess-one jolt and shock after another-packed with poorly digested supernatural elements that feel more nauseating than engaging.<br/><br/>The visual palette is relentlessly ugly: grimy, filthy street locales of Karachi and grotesque, almost monstrous-looking characters make the viewing experience intolerable. Adding to the misery is the continuous assault of ear-splitting noise-endless shouting, shrieking, African tribal chants masquerading as rap, and Punjabi nonsense passed off as music and background score. This sonic chaos feels completely out of place in a Sindhi- and Urdu-speaking city like Karachi and becomes an endurance test rather than entertainment.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt appears in his familiar, tired rogue avatar-nothing new, nothing memorable. Akshaye Khanna fails to convince as Rahman Dakait, looking more like a fatigued, aging man with hollowed cheeks than a fearsome outlaw. Ranvir Sara Arjun is undoubtedly pretty but appears more like Ranveer Singh&#39;s daughter than his romantic counterpart, making the pairing awkward and unconvincing.<br/><br/>The only performances that stand out positively are those of Madhavan and Rakesh Bedi, both of whom deliver their roles with sincerity and restraint amid the surrounding chaos.<br/><br/>Technically, the film fares no better. Action scenes are shot with frantic, shaky camerawork, often resembling footage stuck permanently in fast-forward mode. Fight sequences are incomprehensible-you can barely tell who is hitting whom. Excessive and unjustified darkness dominates most scenes, continuing Bollywood&#39;s unfortunate trend of mistaking poor lighting for cinematic mood.<br/><br/>The story is weak and wildly unrealistic, with characters that are neither believable nor justified. Babu Dakait, supposedly a feared don ruling the city, comes across as a petty street thug. Seeing him zip around Karachi in a broken autorickshaw with his accomplices is unintentionally comic and outright laughable.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a nightmarish experience-badly written, poorly directed, atrociously edited, and shot with substandard cinematography. Performances are largely below average, barring Madhavan and Rakesh Bedi. One is left wondering where viewers found &quot;emotion,&quot; &quot;patriotism,&quot; or &quot;fine performances&quot; in this unimpressive and forgettable film.<br/><br/>Verdict: A complete waste of time and money.<br/><br/>Rating: 2/10.",0,

A lot of Bollywood movies have been made in the spy-action genre, but this is the best one so far.<br/><br/>Bringing so many legends together worked really well.<br/><br/>Before watching the movie, I saw many reels saying Akshay stole the show and was better than the rest-but that&#39;s not true.<br/><br/>Yes, Akshay was very good and it&#39;s a great comeback, but Ranveer was literally the soul of the movie.

rw11099062,upinderswork,,Cinematic Trauma,"I regret watching Dhurandar. The film is an unbearable stretch of narrative. The plot is nonsensical. A spy agent enters Pakistan, becomes instantly famous and persuades a politician to marry his daughter. This is implausible. The story lacks realism and logic. The screenplay, editing and writing are tedious and unengaging. The plot attempts to be a &quot;mass patriotic thriller&quot; but ultimately resembles low-quality fiction. The only saving grace is Akshaye Khanna, who attempts to salvage the film. Without him, the movie would collapse within the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: If you value your time, money and mental well-being, do not watch this film. It is not entertainment; it is cinematic trauma.",0,

Every frame feels intentional, every scene purposeful, and every emotional beat lands exactly where it should.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, the movie grips you. The storytelling is layered yet smooth - complex themes delivered without ever losing clarity or momentum. Dhar builds tension like only he can: not loud, not rushed, but steadily rising until your pulse syncs with the rhythm of the film.<br/><br/>The background score deserves its own applause. It&#39;s atmospheric, intense, and immersive - the kind of score that doesn&#39;t just accompany the visuals, but elevates them. In action sequences, it punches. In emotional moments, it breathes. It&#39;s a rare example of music being as much a character as the actors on screen.<br/><br/>Speaking of action - flawless. Brutal, sharp, grounded and filmed with a commitment to realism rather than chaos. No unnecessary slow-mo, no over-stylization - just pure craft. The choreography, cinematography, and editing combine into a visual language that feels both cinematic and personal.<br/><br/>Performances across the cast are strong, but what stands out is how Dhar uses his actors. Nobody feels wasted. Nobody feels like filler. Every role matters. Every role moves the story.<br/><br/>The film may be facing some negativity online, but much of it feels less like genuine criticism and more like reactionary noise from people who seem uncomfortable with the film&#39;s confidence, tone, or national identity.

rw11023522,amritfrozenbird,,Reality,"Reality of Pakistan.<br/><br/>Point,Rating,Review Summary
1. Performances,9/10,&quot;Stellar Ensemble Cast. Ranveer Singh delivers a restrained, powerful performance as the undercover agent Hamza. Akshaye Khanna, as the gangster Rehman Dakait, is often hailed as a scene-stealer, matching the lead with his chilling presence.&quot;
2. Direction &amp; Vision,8/10,&quot;Aditya Dhar&#39;s Ambitious Scale. The film is lauded for its ambitious, large-scale direction and a clear vision that weaves a gritty spy thriller with a Godfather-esque underworld saga.&quot;
3. World Building,9/10,&quot;Immersive and Gritty. The detailed recreation of Karachi&#39;s Lyari gangwar and the complex nexus of crime, politics, and the ISI is considered a major strength, making the world feel authentic and dangerous.&quot;
4. Screenplay &amp; Plot,7/10,&quot;Compelling, but Stretched. The narrative is gripping and complex, inspired by real events like the Kandahar hijacking and 26/11. However, many critics felt the writing gets stretched in the first half, spending too much time on setup.&quot;
5. Runtime &amp; Pacing,5/10,&quot;Excessively Long. With a runtime of approximately 3 hours and 34 minutes, it&#39;s one of the longest Indian films. The pacing is uneven, which is a major drawback, though the film rarely feels tedious for those invested in the story.&quot;
6. Music &amp; BGM,8/10,&quot;Scintillating Score. The background score and music, which cleverly blend old classics with modern soundscapes, are a triumph that effectively elevates the film&#39;s intense mood and relentless pulse.&quot;
7. Action &amp; Violence,7/10,&quot;Raw and Unflinching. The action sequences are brutal and grounded, contributing to the film&#39;s realism. The violence is unapologetic, adding to the intense tone, though some scenes were noted for poor VFX.&quot;
8. Technical Aspects,8/10,&quot;High Production Value. The cinematography is spectacular, and the production design is realistic and fabulous, lending a top-notch craft quality to the film. Editing is decent but flagged as not top-notch in places.&quot;
9. Emotional Core,7/10,&quot;Patriotism with Subtlety. The film manages to convey the emotional toll and stress of the spy&#39;s life effectively. It touches on patriotism and national security without relying solely on jingoism, focusing on character-driven stakes.&quot;
10. Climax &amp; Sequel Setup,9/10,&quot;Intense Cliffhanger. The film ends on an explosive and masterful twist that completely re-contextualizes the lead character and sets the stage perfectly for the confirmed Part 2, leaving the audience highly anticipating the sequel.&quot;",0,

It isn&#39;t merely entertainment; it&#39;s an experience that lingers in the memory, inviting both awe and reflection.<br/><br/>Plot and Pacing
Dhurandhar crafts a taut, sweeping narrative that balances grand, high-stakes twists with intimate, character-driven moments. The pacing is meticulous: every scene earns its keep, everyline of dialogue lands with precision, and the tension builds with an almost mathematical inevitability. The central mystery hooks you in seconds and never lets go, yet the film never loses sight of the emotional throughline that gives it real soul.<br/><br/>Performances
Lead Performance: A tour de force. Ranveer Singh navigates a roller-coaster of grit, vulnerability, and quiet resolve with a magnetic clarity. Subtle choices-a look here, a tremor there-reveal a character who is both formidable and human.<br/><br/>Supporting Cast:The ensemble elevates the material. Each actor brings texture, nuance, and purpose, turning even small roles into memorable pivots in the story.<br/><br/>Villain/Antagonist: Written with psychological depth, the antagonist is never a caricature. The tension arises from genuine understanding of motive, making confrontations electric and morally complex.<br/><br/>Direction and Craft
The director orchestrates a symphony of tension and tenderness. Visual storytelling is lush yet purposeful-mesmerizing cinematography, purposeful blocking, and a keen eye for detail that rewards repeat viewing.

Directed with strong vision and intensity, the film delivers a gripping blend of espionage, drama, and raw emotion. It follows a dangerous mission filled with betrayal, hidden agendas, and relentless pursuit, making it a compelling watch for fans of serious thrillers.<br/><br/>The movie shines brightest in its action sequences. Every fight scene feels powerful, well-choreographed, and grounded in realism. Whether it&#39;s close-combat hand-to-hand action or explosive gun battles, Dhurandar maintains an adrenaline-filled pace throughout. The cinematography adds to the film&#39;s gritty appeal, capturing the tension and fear of a spy&#39;s life with dark tones and sharp visuals. Background music is another strong element, enhancing the suspense without overshadowing the storytelling.<br/><br/>Performances are solid across the board. The lead actor delivers one of his most intense roles yet-balancing vulnerability with strength. Supporting characters add depth to the narrative, each contributing significantly to the mission&#39;s twists and emotional beats. Antagonists are equally well-portrayed, with their motivations rooted in realism rather than exaggerated villainy.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandar truly excels is in its storytelling rhythm. The screenplay is tightly structured, revealing secrets and surprises at just the right moments. The film explores themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and patriotism, but does not drown in melodrama. Instead, it uses emotions to strengthen the urgency of the mission.<br/><br/>The movie does run on the longer side, and a few scenes might feel stretched, but the overall intensity keeps the momentum alive.

rw11009929,VISHALT-06,,Review: Dhurandar (2025),"Dhurandar&quot; is a gripping action-drama inspired by real incidents, though the core premise may feel familiar to viewers because a similar storyline was earlier explored in Mission Majnu. Despite that, the film manages to stand strong on its own with engaging execution and impressive performances.<br/><br/>The movie is visually striking, and every character is crafted with attention to detail. Ranbir Singh delivers one of his most impactful roles, both in terms of looks and emotional presence. The supporting cast fits their parts well, enhancing the film&#39;s overall intensity.<br/><br/>The action sequences are commendable, though one slight drawback is that Ranbir Singh&#39;s action could have been more hard-hitting-something closer to the raw power seen in KGF 2 with Rocky&#39;s character. Another minor negative is that while Sanjay Dutt plays a strong and dominant role, his one-on-one encounter with Akshay Khanna feels oddly imbalanced, reducing the weight of his character.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the music album is excellent, with &quot;Ishq Jalakar&quot; standing out as a soulful, unforgettable track that elevates the emotional depth of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, &quot;Dhurandar&quot; is a well-made, entertaining film with solid performances, great visuals, and memorable music. Despite a few shortcomings, it remains a highly enjoyable watch for action lovers.<br/><br/>⭐ IMDb Rating (My Opinion): 8/10.",0,

I never feel bored through whole storyline even movie is 3.5 hrs long. Akshay khanna role was the limelight and Ranveer singh keeps the lights on.

rw11010391,ashishbagade,,Awesome epic thrilling brutal bloody,"Dhurandar is just too good. A breath of fresh air after so many unreal, over-the-top and cringeworthy so-called spy or action thrillers. This one is raw, grounded, brutal and absolutely gripping from start to finish. The intensity never dips, the action feels real, and every scene has weight. The performances are solid, the pacing is tight, and the film actually respects the audience&#39;s intelligence. No forced comedy, no unnecessary drama-just a proper, well-crafted, edge-of-the-seat thriller that delivers on every promise.

rw11065465,amitrchandra-27809,,Gripping but excessively long and violent,"The movie is certainly gripping and the nationalist plot based on true events makes it even more appealing. It&#39;s the performances that mostly carry the show - Ranveer Singh delivers without any overacting, and looks his part.

The narrative is gripping, with a serious, grounded tone that makes the action and emotions feel real rather than overdone. What really stands out is how the characters are written - they feel layered, flawed, and human, which makes you care about what happens to them. At times the pacing slows a bit, but overall it&#39;s a solid, engaging watch/read that leaves a strong impression and feels more meaningful than just surface-level entertainment.",0,
rw11028524,SweetyH-5,,🔥 Dhurandhar: A Full-Throttle Cinematic Knockout 🔥,"Dhurandhar is a cinematic knockout that delivers on every front. The casting feels spot-on, with each performance adding weight and authenticity to the narrative. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is confident and razor-sharp, proving once again that he knows how to craft a truly theatre-worthy experience.<br/><br/>The cinematography elevates the film to another level, capturing both scale and intensity with striking visuals. The action sequences are exceptionally choreographed-raw, impactful, and never overdone-keeping the adrenaline high throughout.<br/><br/>A special mention goes to the music. Shashwat absolutely nailed the remixes, seamlessly blending modern energy with the film&#39;s mood, making the soundtrack a major highlight rather than just a background element.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar isn&#39;t just a good film-it&#39;s a full-blown banger.

Supporting characters are equally strong, adding texture to the plot. The director&#39;s attention to detail is evident in every sequence-from political strategy discussions to heart-stopping action scenes. Visual storytelling, combined with smart editing, ensures that even complex subplots remain easy to follow. The film&#39;s score intensifies emotions at key moments, making the audience feel the stakes.

rw11022684,SayantanP-9,,#Dhurandhar,"Just walked out of the cinema after watching #Dhurandhar, and I&#39;m still processing the sheer scale and intensity of Aditya Dhar&#39;s vision. This isn&#39;t just a spy thriller; it&#39;s a gritty, complex underworld saga that uses the espionage framework to explore the brutal realities of covert operations. The film&#39;s strength lies in its refusal to offer easy answers, instead plunging us deep into the perilous world of Lyari, where the lines between criminal, politician, and spy are constantly blurred.<br/><br/>The performances are truly the foundation of this masterpiece. Ranveer Singh as Hamza Ali Mazari delivers a performance defined by restraint and explosive intensity-his transformation from a green operative to a feared figure of authority is a masterclass in controlled acting. But the undeniable show-stealer is Akshaye Khanna as Rehman Dakait. His introduction scene, set to the viral &#39;FA9LA&#39; track, is one of the most electric cinematic moments of the year. He doesn&#39;t shout to exert dominance; he simply is the power, making his character an unforgettable, chilling antagonist.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s runtime is long, but Aditya Dhar utilizes every minute to meticulously build the world and its complex politics, a treatment rarely seen in mainstream Bollywood. The technical departments-from the raw, dusty cinematography to the hard-hitting sound design-deserve special mention for creating such an immersive, unsettling atmosphere.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re looking for a spectacle with depth, incredible performances, and a story that genuinely grips you until the final, shocking tease for the sequel, Dhurandhar is absolutely essential viewing. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible. It&#39;s a bold, brilliant piece of cinema. 🇮🇳🔥

The main genres are organized crime, spy, romance, and politics. The story&#39;s timeline is built around tragic events, but the story itself is fiction.

The car chases and the tension in the Karachi sequences are world-class.<br/><br/>Performances: Ranveer Singh&#39;s restrained performance as Hamza is a career-best, and Akshaye Khanna as Rehman Dakait is absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>The Verdict: &quot;Jordar Movie Che!&quot; It&#39;s not just a spy thriller; it&#39;s a landmark for Indian Cinema.

rw11011226,chetan-146,,Akshaye Khanna Steals the Show in This Gripping Thriller,"Honestly, I went into Dhurandhar without huge expectations, but I walked out completely blown away - mainly because of Akshaye Khanna.<br/><br/>He is on another level in this film. There&#39;s no loud drama, no over-the-top shouting - just pure, controlled, razor-sharp acting. The way he uses his eyes, his pauses, that calm but dangerous energy... he makes every scene feel tense even when he&#39;s just standing quietly in the frame. Whenever he comes on screen, the whole film suddenly feels more serious and important.<br/><br/>The movie itself is gripping - dark, pacy, and engaging from start to finish. The plot has enough twists to keep you hooked, the action scenes are well done, and the world of politics, crime, and power games feels very real. The background score and visuals add a lot to the mood, too.<br/><br/>But for me, this is Akshaye Khanna&#39;s film.<br/><br/>He doesn&#39;t just play the character, he owns it. It&#39;s the kind of performance that reminds you how underrated he actually is and makes you want to see him in many more lead roles.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re a fan of strong acting and intense thrillers, Dhurandhar is a definite must-watch. 10/10, especially for Akshaye Khanna&#39;s brilliant performance.",0,

The film pulls you in quietly and keeps tightening its grip through strong writing and a steadily building screenplay that never feels rushed. Ranveer Singh completely disappears into his role, bringing intensity, vulnerability, and moral conflict in a way that feels very real. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is confident and grounded, balancing action with reflective moments that add depth instead of just spectacle. Performances by Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, R. Madhavan, Sara Arjun, and Manav Gohil add weight and realism, making the world of crime, politics, and espionage feel lived-in. The cinematography and sound design enhance the tension without overpowering it, and the layered storytelling keeps you engaged till the very end.

rw11034209,niteshnivas,,Dhurandhar Review,"Dhurandhar is a film that commands attention from its very first frame and holds it firmly till the end. Despite its long runtime of nearly 3 hours and 30 minutes, the movie never once feels exhausting - a rare achievement in itself. The narration flows with confidence, making the audience completely surrender to its world.<br/><br/>The music is beautifully integrated into the storytelling. The songs arrive naturally, enhancing emotions rather than interrupting the pace. The background score is one of the film&#39;s strongest assets - intense, haunting, and powerful - it amplifies every dramatic moment and elevates the film to a grand cinematic experience.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is its stellar casting. Ranveer Singh dominates the screen with a performance full of intensity and raw energy. Sanjay Dutt brings gravitas and authority, making his presence felt in every scene. Akshaye Khanna impresses with his restrained and layered acting, while R. Madhavan adds emotional depth and balance to the narrative. Each actor fits their role perfectly, making the characters feel lived-in and real.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is striking. Strong cinematography, detailed frames, and sharp editing ensure that the pace never dips. The screenplay is tightly woven, keeping the tension alive throughout and making the lengthy runtime feel surprisingly crisp.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:
Dhurandhar is not just a film, but an experience - powerful performances, stirring music, and confident storytelling come together to deliver a gripping cinematic journey that never feels long. A must-watch for those who enjoy grand, intense cinema.",0,
rw11023922,deboo-c,,An Ensemble-Driven Thriller Where Every Character Matters,"This is a long film, but once it starts, you&#39;re completely pulled in and genuinely don&#39;t realise how time flies. I watched it on a large screen in Brisbane, and the 7:50 pm show was a full house, which is quite rare here, that alone says a lot.<br/><br/>The director deserves massive credit for giving every character equal importance. Not a single role felt like a supporting one; each character had a crucial part to play, and the actors delivered accordingly.<br/><br/>One of the most impressive aspects was the casting. Actors who are mostly known for comedy were given serious, intense roles, and it worked brilliantly. Dhar truly saw the untapped potential in Gaurav Gera and Rakesh Bedi, and it was refreshing and powerful to watch them in such a new light.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, R. Madhavan, and Arjun Rampal were solid as always, they never disappoint. Ranveer Singh once again proved that he&#39;s an exceptional actor who just needs the right director to bring out his best. He should definitely do more films like this. Sanjay Dutt also did a great job.<br/><br/>That said, the real star of the film is the director and the story writer, who brought together such an engaging vision and gripping narrative. There were multiple nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat moments throughout the film.<br/><br/>I genuinely cannot wait for 26th March 2026 to watch Part 2.",0,

rw11016628,aadhithyagopal,,Best spy movie,"Here is a 300-word expanded version of your review, keeping the same tone but making it richer, smoother, and more impactful:<br/><br/>Don&#39;t watch this movie if you&#39;re expecting the usual Bollywood fantasy where the ISI suddenly becomes best friends with RAW, where national agencies shake hands like schoolchildren after a cricket match, or where the heroine randomly appears in a bikini for a beach song that has no connection to the story. If you&#39;re looking for villains who turn into comedians, heroes who defy gravity with cartoonish stunts, and a plot that treats espionage like a superhero comic, then this film is absolutely not for you.<br/><br/>But if you want to watch one of the most realistic, grounded, and uncompromising spy thrillers ever made in Indian cinema, then this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. It doesn&#39;t sugar-coat geopolitics, it doesn&#39;t dilute the brutality of espionage, and it doesn&#39;t insult your intelligence with easy resolutions. Instead, it delivers a tense, gritty, and emotionally charged narrative that respects both the craft of filmmaking and the audience&#39;s maturity.<br/><br/>Every frame feels researched, every character feels lived-in, and every decision carries weight. The film shows espionage not as a glamorous profession but as a world filled with moral ambiguity, sacrifice, and constant danger. There are no superheroes here-only humans pushed to their physical and emotional limits.<br/><br/>The performances elevate the movie even further. The lead actor gives one of his most intense portrayals, carrying the story with raw vulnerability and controlled aggression. The supporting cast, especially the antagonist, adds layers that make the conflict feel chillingly real.<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography, and sound design work together to create an immersive world that pulls you into the tension and never lets you breathe easily.<br/><br/>In short: this is not just a movie, it&#39;s an experience-a rare spy thriller that prioritizes authenticity over spectacle. If you want reality, depth, and world-class storytelling, don&#39;t miss this film.",0,

rw11013987,Gauravr-6450,,Review,"Just woww Dhurdhar is a remarkable and emotionally gripping masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact on every viewer. From its very first frame to the final moments, the film holds your attention with its raw realism, powerful performances, and deeply meaningful storytelling. What makes Dhurdhar stand out is its courage to explore human emotions and social truths without any filters. The narrative does not rely on unnecessary glamour or exaggerated drama; instead, it rises on the strength of honesty, sensitivity, and a profound understanding of life.<br/><br/>The characters are beautifully written, each carrying layers of depth and complexity. Their struggles, dreams, and internal conflicts feel incredibly real, making it easy for viewers to connect with them. The lead performance is exceptional-subtle yet intense-perfectly capturing the emotional weight of the story. The supporting cast also shines, giving life to every scene and enriching the film&#39;s atmosphere.<br/><br/>The direction of Dhurdhar deserves special praise. Every scene is crafted with purpose. The pacing is steady, allowing the audience to absorb the pain, hope, and beauty hidden in small moments. The cinematography enhances the storytelling with stunning visuals that feel both artistic and authentic. The music and background score are soulful, elevating the emotional experience of the film.<br/><br/>What truly makes Dhurdhar a masterpiece is its message. It challenges social norms, encourages self-reflection, and brings out the reality many choose to ignore. The film doesn&#39;t just entertain-it educates, inspires, and provokes thought. Even after the credits roll, its impact stays with the viewer.<br/><br/>In a world full of superficial content, Dhurdhar stands tall as a rare gem-bold, meaningful, and unforgettable. It is not just a film;",0,
rw11012653,navkishlay,,"A Masterstroke of Grit and Grace - ""Dhurandhar"" Redefines Indian Storytelling","Dhurandhar is not just a film-it&#39;s a force of storytelling that grips you from its very first frame. Every element, from the rugged landscapes to the haunting silences between characters, speaks of a director in complete command of his craft.<br/><br/>The narrative doesn&#39;t rush; it breathes, allowing each moment to build tension, emotion, and meaning. The ensemble cast elevates this film to powerhouse status, with each actor delivering career-defining turns.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh commands the screen as the unyielding protagonist, channeling raw fury and vulnerability in a transformative performance that swings from explosive energy to heartbreaking subtlety-his best work yet.<br/><br/>Akshay Khanna brings chilling precision to his antagonist role, his steely gaze and measured menace making every scene crackle with dread.<br/><br/>Rakesh Bedi shines in a pivotal supporting part, infusing warmth and tragic depth that grounds the chaos with authentic emotional heft.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt roars back with gravelly intensity as the grizzled mentor figure, his presence a thunderous reminder of his enduring charisma. Arjun Rampal, brooding and magnetic, delivers a layered portrayal of conflicted loyalty that adds moral complexity, stealing scenes with his brooding physicality and quiet rage.<br/><br/>Technically, Dhurandhar is a visual triumph. The cinematography captures contrasts-light and shadow, chaos and calm-with poetic precision. The background score never overpowers; it heightens.<br/><br/>Together, they create an immersive experience that feels both intimate and epic. But where Dhurandhar truly excels is its storytelling. It fuses socio-political commentary with personal struggle, making you question what heroism really means in today&#39;s world.<br/><br/>There&#39;s an honesty here that&#39;s rare in contemporary cinema-gritty, unflinching, and profoundly moving.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar isn&#39;t a film you merely watch; it&#39;s a film you live through. It&#39;s cinema that dares to challenge, to move, and to stay with you long after you&#39;ve left the theatre.",0,
rw11015749,sudhanshubmwilcoin,,The fire,"Superb movie, well edited.lovely music ,exceptional storyline. A movie which does not divulge a tiny bit from its plot. Best casting.

A proper spy movie.<br/><br/>What sets it apart is the arch of protagonist as he rises in the hierarchy with single point mission on his mind.",0,
rw11096918,Heroman-7,,perfecto,"Dhurandhar is one of those films that doesn&#39;t try to shout at you from the very first frame - instead, it slowly pulls you in and makes you stay. What I really liked is how grounded the movie feels. The story isn&#39;t overloaded with unnecessary twists; it moves at its own pace, letting the characters breathe and feel real.<br/><br/>The lead character is easily the backbone of the film. You can actually sense the weight he&#39;s carrying - the frustration, the small victories, the quiet anger. Nothing feels overly dramatic or &quot;movie-ish.&quot; Even the supporting characters have purpose, especially in the way they shape the main character&#39;s journey.<br/><br/>What surprised me most was the tone. It balances intensity with subtle humor and emotional moments without turning into melodrama. The dialogues feel natural, like conversations you&#39;d actually overhear in real life. And the direction deserves credit for keeping things controlled instead of flashy.<br/><br/>Visually, the film has a slightly raw look, which works really well. The background score doesn&#39;t overpower scenes; it gently pushes them forward. A few moments feel stretched, and there are places where you wish the pacing was tighter - but nothing that completely pulls you out.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandhar really wins is in its message. It doesn&#39;t preach, yet it leaves you thinking about choices, ego, pride, and the quiet battles people fight behind closed doors. When the credits roll, you don&#39;t feel &quot;wow, that was huge&quot; - instead, you feel a quiet satisfaction, like you just watched something honest.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. But it is sincere, well-acted, and meaningful - the kind of film that stays with you for a bit after you leave the theater.<br/><br/>If you like character-driven stories over loud action or forced comedy, Dhurandhar is definitely worth watching.",0,

Scored at 8 out of 10, the film stands out for its confident direction, atmospheric tension, and a lead performance that elevates nearly every scene.<br/><br/>The story follows its central character-an enigmatic, morally complex figure whose past haunts every decision he makes. The writing excels in the way it balances his inner conflict with high-stakes external threats. Instead of relying only on action, the film invests time into building his personal relationships, motivations, and vulnerabilities. This makes the emotional beats feel genuinely earned.<br/><br/>Visually, Dhurandhar is impressive. The cinematography creates a gritty yet cinematic world, with well-composed shots and fluid action sequences that avoid unnecessary over-stylization. The background score complements the tone without overpowering it, and the pacing, though occasionally uneven in the second half, stays engaging overall.<br/><br/>Performances are one of the film&#39;s strongest pillars. The lead actor brings depth and intensity, portraying the character&#39;s turmoil with subtlety. The supporting cast also shines, especially in moments where the film slows down to explore trust, betrayal, and survival.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandhar falters slightly is in its predictability during a few key twists. Some plot points follow familiar genre beats, and certain characters could have benefited from more development. However, these shortcomings don&#39;t take away from the overall experience, which remains consistently entertaining.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Dhurandhar delivers a compelling combination of storytelling, action, and emotion.

rw11024389,NeeleshA-05,,Mind blowing,"Here&#39;s a clear, straight-talk review of Dhurandhar (2025) based on critics, audience reaction, and industry voices.<br/><br/>What the movie is
Dhurandhar is a high-budget Hindi spy action thriller directed by Aditya Dhar, starring Ranveer Singh, Akshaye Khanna, R. Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal and Sara Arjun. It&#39;s a long film - over three hours - that places an Indian agent deep in Karachi&#39;s underworld as part of a covert mission.<br/><br/>Strengths
You&#39;ll hear a lot of praise for the performances. Ranveer Singh and Akshaye Khanna are frequently singled out as the anchors of the story, giving intense and committed turns. Many viewers and peers in the industry have called it powerful, gripping and entertaining, with strong direction and a compelling narrative that holds attention despite its length.<br/><br/>The background score and production values also stand out, and audiences have reacted very positively on social platforms, with many calling it a &quot;blockbuster-level&quot; experience.<br/><br/>It&#39;s also doing exceptionally well commercially, crossing big box office milestones and becoming one of the top Hindi films of the year.<br/><br/>Weaknesses
Not every reviewer is enthusiastic. Some critics feel Dhurandhar is overly long and at times loses focus under its own ambition. A few point to pacing issues, a heavy dose of violence, and what they see as jingoistic or politically loaded themes. The storytelling can feel uneven, especially in the second half, according to certain reviews.<br/><br/>There&#39;s also been controversy around how it&#39;s interpreted and discussed online. Some reviews prompted strong reactions from fans, and critics&#39; groups had to speak out against harassment over differing opinions.<br/><br/>Overall take
This is a major commercial and cultural moment movie. If you like big, heavy-emotional action thrillers with strong performances and cinematic scale, you&#39;ll probably enjoy it. If you prefer tighter writing and subtler themes, it might feel overblown or heavy-handed. It&#39;s ambitious, flawed, but hard to ignore - a film that&#39;s as likely to be talked about for its craft as its impact outside the theater.<br/><br/>It&#39;s worth watching for the craft and performances, while being aware it isn&#39;t a small, nuanced thriller.",0,
rw11014317,amritacr,,Thats what I call real BOLLYWOOD,If you are sick of khans movies and kjo&#39;s unrealistic drama congratulations you can now go back to theatres. Aditya Dhars&#39;s DHURANDHAR is in one word a masterpiece. Very well researched. And the casting is extraordinary it would be wrong to mention only few. Ranveer Singh seems to have just drowned in the character. Maddy and Gaurav Gera are unrecognisable. Akshay Khanna justified his talents in a negative role. Finally a movie not seeking any propoganda but showing reality of struggles of India as a nation and people who protects it from enemies inside and out. So eagerly waiting for REVENGE now!!!!,0,
rw11007383,vijayvighnesh-18289,,New Think Tank,"In a time when Bollywood keeps pushing love-and-dump stories, Dhurandhar is a different level.

Encourage you all to have a watch.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar delivered a strong film. Awaiter for the part 2 showing how the story moves forward would be worth watching.",0,
rw11040852,hanan-77633,,A Knockout punch to the YRF Spy Universe.,"I was waiting for this film since the last year and it pretty much met my expectations. I was a mind-blowing experience to see such an unfiltered, violent and masculine story which revolves around true events.<br/><br/>Let&#39;s talk about each aspect one by one.<br/><br/>Film has an exceptionally great production design. The world it builds. The ganglands of Lyari and even the little details, like vehicles, shops, buildings and even the roads, look exactly as they are in Pakistan. Each and every element regarding the world-building in this film adds a lot to the story makes uplifts the experience by many fold. Even the characters feel real as they don&#39;t use the cliché words like &quot;Jaan&quot;, &quot;Miyan&quot; and &quot;Adaab&quot; only a little bit but very wisely. That makes the film very authentic.<br/><br/>Casting deserves great appreciation as each actor feels like he was meant to play that role. Akshaye Khanna and Sanjay Dutt looked almost the same as real Rehman Dakait and Chaudhary Aslam. Arjum Rampal and R. Madhavan were great choices too and I believe we&#39;d see more of their work in the next part. Even small characters like the guy appeared as &quot;Ajmal Kasab&quot; and Rakesh Bedi as &quot;Jamil Jamali&quot;, were exceptionally great casting choices as well. Each actor delivered his best performance as well but the crown goes to Akshaye Khanna and Runner-up to Rakesh Bedi. Ranveer Singh&#39;s character was literally getting outshined by everyone else around him and I&#39;ve seen people complaining about it but I believe that was necessary because he is playing a spy and a spy must remain in the shadows, not like those YRF films that just revolve around the spy.<br/><br/>Shashwat Sachdeva nailed it. Literally each track in the film is pure masterclass. The title track was a banger and every other track was amazing. Even the old songs that were edited and used in the films were too good and elevated the scene. The only part where the music felt off track was the track &quot;Shararat&quot; which felt completely useless and out of place. The makers should&#39;ve skipped that track. Otherwise, the music was great.<br/><br/>Adithya Dhar went beast mode with this film. I mean, I was seen his other two films as well but man, this time, he is unstoppable. Film is over 210 minutes long, which is too much nowadays but still it doesn&#39;t get boring or cliché over even a second. Dividing the entire film into chapters was a great choice as it divides the time duration and the film as a whole never feels too long despite its absurdly long runtime. The use of real footages and recordings, the gut-wrenching violence and the masterful direction made this film a must-watch.<br/><br/>The part where this film felt slightly weak was the the writing. Although the film was great but the lack of thrill element makes it a bit predictable. I mean, the spy gets his way too easily into the gang, which felt a bit off. There isn&#39;t any high-tension point in the story where we get thrilled about what would happen next. It&#39;s just a bit too straight. Also, the love angle in the film is a bit awkward as well. I mean, they have acknowledged the age gap between the characters of Sara Arjun&#39;s and Ranveer Singh&#39;s characters in the film and tried to justify it too but still, I felt a bit uncomfortable when they came together. There wasn&#39;t any chemistry between the two actors and the makers should&#39;ve thought of something better.<br/><br/>Finally, I&#39;d say that the film is definitely not for everyone. It&#39;s great but for some sections of the audience, it&#39;s going to be a tough sit. The film is filled with violence, adult language and some parts of the story are fictionalized. I have researched about the Lyari gang wars years before this film was made and I can say the film is a work of fiction, blend into real life events, much similar to what Tarantino did in &quot;Inglorious Basterds&quot;.

rw11014409,rjmandhane,,A Masterclass in Cinematic Ambition and Technical Excellence!,"Dhurandhar stands as a remarkable achievement in Indian cinema-a sprawling, ambitious spy thriller that demonstrates why patience and meticulous filmmaking can transform a nearly three-and-a-half-hour runtime into an utterly captivating experience. Director Aditya Dhar has crafted a film that refuses to be confined by conventional narrative formulas, instead delivering a visually and thematically rich epic that engages audiences throughout its considerable length while leaving them eagerly anticipating the promised sequel.<br/><br/>From its opening frames, Dhurandhar announces itself as a film of uncommon ambition and technical precision. Aditya Dhar&#39;s directorial vision is evident in every meticulously composed frame, transforming the gritty criminal underworld of Karachi&#39;s Lyari district into a character unto itself. The director&#39;s commitment to immersive world-building creates an atmosphere of palpable tension-one that never relinquishes its grip on the viewer despite the film&#39;s substantial length. What could easily have become a cumbersome narrative instead becomes a methodical, deliberate unfolding of a complex geopolitical chess game, where every scene serves a purpose in building the film&#39;s layered complexity.<br/><br/>The technical execution deserves singular praise. Cinematographer Vikash Nowlakha delivers visually stunning work that captures both the sweeping vistas and claustrophobic intensity of the underworld setting, plunging viewers directly into the dusty, dangerous alleys of Karachi. The editing by Shivkumar V. Panicker maintains remarkable control over the narrative&#39;s rhythm, ensuring that even the film&#39;s longest sequences never feel bloated or self-indulgent. This technical precision is crucial-it transforms what could have been an exercise in excessive length into something genuinely cinematic, where every minute finds justification in Dhar&#39;s ambitious world-building.<br/><br/>The background score by Shashwat Sachdev deserves particular commendation for its intelligent use of classic, vintage soundtracks that serve as a constant emotional undercurrent throughout the film. Rather than relying on bombastic, intrusive scoring, Sachdev crafts a musical landscape that functions as a pulsating heartbeat beneath the narrative-ensuring tension never dips while maintaining an authentic, lived-in quality. The score&#39;s sophisticated composition reveals itself as a character in its own right, subtly elevating emotional beats without ever overshadowing the intimate character moments that anchor this sprawling epic.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast delivers performances of remarkable depth and nuance. Ranveer Singh&#39;s portrayal of Hamza Ali Mazhari represents arguably the finest work of his career-a transformation so complete that the actor essentially disappears into the character. His performance navigates the treacherous emotional terrain with surgical precision: displaying steely determination in one moment, raw vulnerability in the next, creating a protagonist whose internal dilemmas feel profoundly relatable despite his extraordinary circumstances. Alongside him, Akshaye Khanna provides a superbly controlled, scene-lifting performance as Rehman Dakait that proves utterly magnetic. The chemistry and friction between these two actors form the electric core of the film, generating some of the most compelling dramatic moments in contemporary Indian cinema.<br/><br/>The supporting cast elevates the entire enterprise. Sanjay Dutt brings an understated menace to his role as SP Chaudhary Aslam, while Arjun Rampal&#39;s quiet intimidation creates an unsettling contrast with other performances. R. Madhavan and Akshaye Khanna add intelligence and depth to the ensemble, ensuring that even smaller roles feel fully realized and contribute meaningfully to the narrative&#39;s intricate tapestry.<br/><br/>What makes Dhurandhar particularly impressive is its refusal to apologize for its ambition. Rather than trimming itself to fit conventional expectations about commercial cinema, the film invests its considerable runtime in character development, relationship building, and world-establishment that pays extraordinary dividends when the action sequences erupt with brutal precision. The action choreography itself is meticulous, immediate, and entirely free of unnecessary flourish-each confrontation feels earned and meaningful rather than inserted merely for spectacle.<br/><br/>The narrative structure, while occasionally testing audience patience with its deliberate pacing, ultimately justifies its length through sheer craftsmanship. The film&#39;s multiple chapters create a visually stylish architecture that compartmentalizes its narrative while maintaining forward momentum. This approach transforms what could have been an unwieldy runtime into a sophisticated, multi-layered exploration of espionage, betrayal, political intrigue, and the moral compromises demanded of those operating in shadowy spaces between nations.<br/><br/>The ending, in particular, proves tantalizing enough to generate genuine anticipation for the promised sequel scheduled for March 2026. Rather than attempting to wrap everything into neat resolution, Dhurandhar leaves narrative threads deliberately open, establishing questions that demand answers and character arcs that cry out for continuation. This approach demonstrates confidence in the property and pays respect to the complexity established throughout the film&#39;s runtime.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is ultimately a film for those willing to surrender themselves to its vision-an immersive, technically brilliant, and deeply engaging experience that rewards patience with spectacle, intelligence, and genuine emotional resonance. It represents a bold statement about what Indian cinema can achieve when a director commits fully to his artistic vision, and the technical and creative team executes with precision and passion. For audiences seeking a film that respects their intelligence while delivering the visceral thrills of a world-class spy thriller, Dhurandhar stands as an essential cinematic experience that justifies every one of its 214 minutes.",0,

rw11012544,grumpyfanatic,,Indian cinema at its PEAKKKK,"Dhurandhar is one of those rare films that quietly enters the theatres but leaves an unforgettable mark on everyone who watches it. In a time when cinema is often driven by noise, spectacle, and formula, Dhurandhar stands tall as a reminder of what sincere filmmaking truly looks like. This movie deserves not just our attention, but our respect and support-because every little detail about it is crafted with intention, skill, and a deep understanding of storytelling.<br/><br/>Right from the opening frame, you can sense the care poured into the film&#39;s creation. The cinematography sets the tone beautifully, capturing both the intimacy of the characters&#39; emotions and the vastness of the world they inhabit. Nothing feels forced or exaggerated. Even in its simplest shots, the film manages to communicate more than many big-budget blockbusters do with mountains of visual effects. The colour palette, the lighting, the framing-each element contributes to the emotional weight of the story.<br/><br/>The performances are another standout. Every actor, regardless of screen time, adds something meaningful. The lead delivers a layered, honest portrayal that draws you into the character&#39;s journey rather than demanding your sympathy. The supporting cast complements this beautifully, grounding the narrative with authenticity. There are no weak links, no over-the-top dramatics-just pure, heartfelt acting.<br/><br/>What truly elevates Dhurandhar is the writing. The screenplay is tight, purposeful, and immersive. Every dialogue serves the narrative; every silence carries meaning. The character arcs unfold organically, giving the audience time to connect with the emotions at play. There&#39;s a maturity in the storytelling-no shortcuts, no pandering. The film trusts its viewers and respects their intelligence, which is refreshing.<br/><br/>The background score and music deserve special mention. Rather than overpowering scenes, the music enriches them. Subtle notes enhance delicate moments, while stronger compositions bring depth to the film&#39;s more intense sequences. It&#39;s the kind of soundtrack that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Equally impressive is the film&#39;s production design. Whether it&#39;s the interiors of a modest home or the dynamics of a bustling street, everything feels lived-in and real. The attention to detail is astonishing-props, costumes, and locations all reflect the world the characters belong to. It&#39;s clear that every department worked with passion and clarity of vision.",0,
rw11010661,SamikshaS-096,,Masterpiece,"A movie that doesn&#39;t keep you on unnecessary edge but provides you the ground touch to reality. Amazing.

Counting days.",0,
rw11041432,bansalgaurav,,"Dhurandhar: A Bold, Brilliant Masterpiece That Redefines Reality Through Cinema","Dhurandhar is an absolute masterpiece-a film that doesn&#39;t just tell a story, it unravels history, psychology, and geopolitics with rare cinematic courage.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is the way the reality of Indo-Pak relationships is shown in an exceptionally imaginative way. Instead of relying on loud nationalism or predictable tropes, the film dives into the grey zones-where intelligence, sacrifice, deception, and diplomacy collide. Every scene feels layered, intentional, and deeply researched, making the narrative gripping without ever feeling exaggerated.<br/><br/>The fact that it is based on true events makes this even more realistic and public-expectation-defying. You constantly feel the weight of authenticity-this isn&#39;t fiction designed to please; it&#39;s truth designed to provoke thought. The storytelling respects the audience&#39;s intelligence, trusting viewers to connect the dots rather than spoon-feeding emotions or conclusions.<br/><br/>Performances are razor-sharp, with characters that feel lived-in rather than written. The tension builds quietly but relentlessly, and the emotional payoff lands hard because it feels earned. The direction deserves special praise for balancing realism with cinematic brilliance-never documentary-dry, never melodramatic.<br/><br/>In short, Dhurandhar is not just a movie; it&#39;s an experience. Bold, intelligent, unsettling, and unforgettable.<br/><br/>A film that stays with you long after the credits roll-and one that raises the bar for political and historical cinema in India.",0,
rw11007179,parthpandotra,,Absolute Banger.,"From the very first frame, Dhurandhar grabs you by the collar. The backdrop of underworld politics and covert operations inspired loosely by real events lends a dark, gritty flavour to the narrative. What makes the film compelling is how it refuses to sugarcoat its world, the violence feels raw and grounded, the stakes feel real, and the chaos of gang wars is brought to life with relentless energy. The ensemble cast is a major strength. Ranveer Singh leads with quiet intensity brooding and determined, his character carries the film&#39;s emotional weight well. But the film truly shines when Akshaye Khanna steps in: his performance is chilling, compelling and memorable a standout that elevates the entire movie. Supporting actors add depth, and even smaller roles feel lived-in, authentic which adds to the immersive ambience. Technically too, the film is impressive. The cinematography captures both sprawling underworld grime and tense interior moments with equal skill. The background score and music weave through the narrative, amplifying tension, emotion and drama often giving you goosebumps, especially during the climactic scenes. Dhurandhar leaves an impact. It isn&#39;t light entertainment it demands attention, but rewards it with raw emotion, high stakes and powerful performances. For those who appreciate bold, intense spy-thrillers that don&#39;t compromise on grit or scale, Dhurandhar is not just a film, it&#39;s an experience.",0,

rw11005025,Divyansh_Verma_2003,,Gourmet Cinema: A Benchmark Above the Sloppy Universes,"Honestly, this film is a pure masterclass. Everything-from the tight, snappy editing and pulse-pounding stunts to the razor-sharp dialogues, committed acting, and decisive direction-delivers exactly what you want a spy espionage film to stylistically have. We&#39;ve hit a true breakthrough moment in Indian cinema here.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope the audience support matches this quality (because, let&#39;s be real, this needs to succeed on a level far beyond the generic, certified-low-effort slops we&#39;ve seen recently, like War 2 or Gadar 2, and the various sloppy cinematic universes. You get the point!).<br/><br/>The Cast: Unhinged, Unrecognizable, and Phenomenal
Akshayae simply out-classed everyone; he absolutely owned the screen!<br/><br/>Ranveer had a perfectly built-up mysterious aura that anchored the story.<br/><br/>All the supporting casts were phenomenal and totally deserved their screen time.<br/><br/>Madhawan was genuinely unrecognizable in his role-a phenomenal transformation.<br/><br/>Dutt&#39;s presentation is surprisingly fresh and different, playing out against what most viewers might expect.<br/><br/>Rampal was unhinged in the best way. Given his role, I&#39;m expecting them to explore much more of his story in the next film.<br/><br/>Sara Arjun&#39;s character also worked incredibly well. The level of self-awareness in this film is brilliant; they even managed to mock her relationship through a quick dialogue!<br/><br/>Spinoff Potential &amp; The Aditya Dhar Universe
There&#39;s a serious potential Aditya Dhar Universe building up here, based on a single reference dropped from URI. Time will tell if that&#39;s true, but I genuinely think they should pursue it aggressively. They need to teach a lesson to the sloppy cinematic universes we&#39;ve been subject to in recent years!<br/><br/>Yes, some specific dialogue placements do feel slightly propagandous or overly patriotic, but honestly, that&#39;s entirely forgivable when everything else surrounding it-the plot, the pace, the technical execution-has been knocked completely out of the park.<br/><br/>The Technical High &amp; Music
I was hooked right from the first shot of the first chapter. The music and the cinematography just instantly pulled me into this world. Right from that opening moment, I knew I was in for a real cinephile&#39;s treat, and I never felt the length-absolutely not!<br/><br/>This is the exact testosterone high I was deprived of since Animal. I was actually worried beforehand (from the music launches) that this might end up being too heavy on the love and romance between Sara and Ranveer, but thankfully, that concern didn&#39;t materialize.<br/><br/>And a major shout-out to the music department: they hit a home run. So much of the background music and the various background tunes used here are straight-up jams! I am convinced the makers will have to upload them straight to YouTube on public demand very soon.<br/><br/>The Wait for Part 2 is Torture!<br/><br/>LAST BUT NOT LEAST: I absolutely cannot wait for Part 2! March 19 feels way too long, darn it! They should have kept the gap shorter, maybe at eight weeks, or at least closer, like Nishanchi, Gangs of Wasseypur, and Sapta Sagaradaache Ello.",0,

The film dives deep into the underbelly of power, crime, and corruption, presenting a narrative that feels uncomfortably close to real life. What makes Dhurandhar truly engaging is its refusal to oversimplify-every character is layered, morally grey, and driven by believable motivations.<br/><br/>The direction is crisp, maintaining a tense pace without sacrificing depth. The screenplay cleverly intertwines multiple storylines, gradually revealing hidden connections that keep the viewer fully invested. The performances are a major highlight: the lead actors deliver intense, controlled portrayals that bring authenticity to each scene. The supporting cast, too, adds weight, especially in moments dealing with political manipulation and gangland dynamics.<br/><br/>Cinematography effectively captures the rawness of urban chaos, using shadows, tight frames, and atmospheric lighting to build a sense of constant unease. The background score amplifies this tone without ever becoming overwhelming.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar succeeds as both entertainment and commentary. It doesn&#39;t just tell a story-it forces viewers to reflect on the blurred boundaries between governance, crime, and ambition. A must-watch for fans of hard-hitting, intelligent cinema.",0,
rw11012854,thybhatta,,One of the most well made bollywood films of recent times,"Dhurandhar is the kind of that deserves the big screen, the grandeur, and the audience hooting along all add to the experience. While some far left critics have labelled them as &#39;pure propoganda&#39; which much like the film is an exaggeration of truth. Sure, the film is probably not a historical recount, but that aside it is an extemely well produced film.<br/><br/>The background music absolutely bangs, the performances feel real, and Akshay Khanna is going to stay with you long after the film ends. The story and the timelines are woven really well and the action is entertaining.<br/><br/>Where the film falters-and why it isn&#39;t a 10/10 for me- Some of the gore doesn&#39;t land because the VFX feels off, the bloodied faces look too animated and break the immersion. Sanjay Dutt&#39;s intro scene is a green screen shot, the kind that immediately pulls you out of the moment. The film could also have been tighter by at least 5-10 minutes, Ex- Ranveer&#39;s club entry could&#39;ve been straightforward instead of dragging through the &quot;no stags&quot; bit.<br/><br/>But the film deserves an unbiased watch for the sheer production scale. Jaao, you&#39;ll have fun.",0,
rw11006498,soniya-77807,,"Action That Roars, Drama That Touches","Each scene is meticulously crafted, slowly building a tension that culminates in explosive action. Ranveer Singh delivers a career-defining performance, blending physicality with quiet emotional depth. Dhar&#39;s direction ensures that the story never feels rushed, giving space for secondary characters to shine. The political and criminal undercurrents are woven seamlessly into the plot, while cinematography captures both grandeur and intimacy. The climax is powerful, leaving a lasting impression that lingers well beyond the runtime.",0,
rw11013509,gchq-58427,,"Oustanding storyline, amazing performances, remains true and raw to its core.","This is hands down the best espionage film ever made by Bollywood. The storyline is very gripping and maintains parallelism with the actual events. It does not try to spread any fake peace agenda or overly flashy movies that are commonly made by Bollywood (YRF is crying in the corner). The acting is top-notch, the soundtrack is bombastic, the action scenes are wonderfully choreographed, and the depiction of an actual spy is damn realistic. A must-watch film for everyone (except the weak-hearted or leftist people).",0,

Supporting actors, even in brief roles, leave lasting impressions due to the director&#39;s careful guidance and casting choices.",0,
rw11030106,kashishnada-92389,,"It's a masterpiece, Indian Film Making has come a long way","Wow, just wow. Dhurandhar is a complete masterpiece - Indian filmmaking has truly come a long way with this one. Aditya Dhar is hands down the best director working in Bollywood right now; he doesn&#39;t give up on that classic Indian style but elevates it to something world-class. This is pure entertainment, a thrilling ride with an incredible storyline that keeps you hooked from start to finish. I&#39;m not here to judge anyone or anything - it&#39;s just a fantastically engaging movie that delivers non-stop tension and excitement.<br/><br/>The acting is great across the board. Ranveer Singh is phenomenal, totally immersed in his character, and the supporting cast - Akshaye Khanna, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, Sanjay Dutt - everyone brings their A-game. Sanjay Dutt&#39;s entry is pure fire - that massy, over-the-top moment with the upbeat track, raining bullets, and all that swagger as he takes on the gangsters. And trivia: it&#39;s straight-up mature Bollywood cinema in 2025, embracing that heroic, larger-than-life vibe we love, especially in a gritty underworld setup involving arms trafficking and high-stakes ops. Lol, it had the theater erupting!<br/><br/>Character development is spot on; you really feel for these people as the story unfolds. The background music is killer, building the atmosphere perfectly.<br/><br/>Cinematography is stunning - those gritty shots of the underworld pull you right in. (Spoiler ahead, skip if you haven&#39;t seen it) One sequence where Ranveer&#39;s character sees the ghost of Akshaye Khanna&#39;s character is straight out of a Julius Caesar reference, with that Shakespearean betrayal vibe - it&#39;s haunting and brilliantly done.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a slow burn that reminds me a lot of The Departed, with all the infiltration, betrayals, and moral gray areas. I don&#39;t know how historically accurate the representation of the Baloch people is, but I really liked how it was portrayed - felt authentic and added depth.<br/><br/>Sure, there&#39;s a bit of bias towards India, but come on, it&#39;s made for a mass audience here, and at its core, it&#39;s about national identity and pride - religion aside, it&#39;s just a solid thriller. The movie shows both sides too, even the failures and complexities on the Indian side, which makes it more balanced than you might expect.<br/><br/>I usually don&#39;t watch much Bollywood these days, but this one? It&#39;s going to be a cult classic, right up there with Devdas and Gangs of Wasseypur. The level of ambition, execution, and sheer guts is unmatched.<br/><br/>I really hope Aditya Dhar stays original in the second part and doesn&#39;t get swayed by critics or the success - keep it as raw and authentic as this one.<br/><br/>One suggestion: it should be dubbed properly in other languages (they can even use AI now for better quality), so international audiences can enjoy it too. But honestly, watch it in the original Hindi with subtitles - that&#39;s the best way to experience the dialogues and performances.<br/><br/>If you love intense spy thrillers, go see this in theaters. You won&#39;t regret it! Can&#39;t wait for Part 2.",0,

You would really have to shut your eyes and look away from the screen.<br/><br/>Sprinkled with a few lighthearted moments that lighten the rather intense story. The romantic subplot slows down the story. Even if it is somewhat integral in taking it forward, I found it to be the weakest link in the narrative.<br/><br/>The story also delves into some gut-wrenchingly painful real-life footage that is bound to break you in ways you can&#39;t imagine, and leaves you in awe of how it was able to be filmed, given its sensitive and traumatic nature.<br/><br/>The climax is exhilaratingly thrilling, which keeps you hooked to your seats until the penultimate scene.

rw11025767,divakrkumarp,,"One of the Best ""True-Event-Inspired"" Movies with a Powerful Star Cast, Outstanding Performances, and Exceptional Sound & BGM","Dhurandhar is one of the finest films of recent times and easily stands out as one of the best movies of 2025. Bollywood has rarely attempted storytelling at this scale or depth. The way the film blends real-life-inspired events-such as the Parliament attack and 26/11 Mumbai attacks-into a gripping narrative is both bold and impactful.<br/><br/>The movie powerfully portrays how terror networks operate across borders, showing the interconnections between Pakistan-based terror groups, local criminal gangs, and the alleged involvement of intelligence networks like the ISI, as represented in the film. It also highlights how masterminds operate from across the border while maintaining layers of deniability-an angle that mainstream cinema often avoids or softens.<br/><br/>The second major theme explored in the movie-the circulation of fake currency through routes like Nepal and Bangladesh and the expansion of hawala networks-adds another chilling layer to the story. The film depicts how these underground financial systems helped sustain terror operations for years. It also raises uncomfortable questions about systemic failures and how such networks managed to thrive even as financial systems evolved-points that have been discussed in documentaries and eyewitness accounts over time.<br/><br/>Director Aditya Dhar deserves immense credit for crafting a true cinematic masterpiece. The way he connects every scene, character, and event with precision shows exceptional vision and storytelling maturity. Each sequence feels purposeful, intense, and rooted in realism, making the narrative both engaging and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The performances elevate the film to another level.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna delivers a controlled yet powerful performance.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh brings intensity and depth to his role.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal, Sanjay Dutt, and Rakesh Bedi contribute strong, memorable performances that leave a lasting impact.<br/><br/>The sound design and background score perfectly complement the tension and emotional weight of the story, enhancing the cinematic experience throughout.<br/><br/>Final Verdict<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is undoubtedly one of the best films in Indian cinema in recent years-a bold, intense, and must-watch movie for anyone who appreciates powerful storytelling rooted in real-world events.<br/><br/>⭐ Highly recommended.

(Spoilers)","I went into Dhurandhar expecting a regular action-crime film, but what I experienced was beyond anything I&#39;ve watched lately. This movie doesn&#39;t just tell a story, it drags you into the brutal world of a man shaped by injustice, betrayal, and survival.<br/><br/>From the opening moments, where the young protagonist watches his world collapse due to a corrupt political system, the film sets the tone: raw, emotional, and unapologetic. The transformation from a helpless boy to the monstrous force known as Dhurandhar is one of the best character arcs I&#39;ve seen.<br/><br/>The action sequences are not just flashy, they are visceral and meaningful. Every punch, every bullet has a purpose. And that interval block? Absolute goosebumps. The BGM roars like a war cry every time Dhurandhar unleashes his rage, turning simple scenes into iconic moments.<br/><br/>The real shocker is the betrayal twist, the friend he trusted the most ends up being the one who sells him out, pushing him into full-fledged vengeance mode. The final showdown, with Dhurandhar standing alone covered in blood, choosing to embrace the monster society forced him to become, that hit hard. The movie doesn&#39;t end with a clean victory. Instead, it leaves us questioning justice, power, and survival.<br/><br/>Despite the violence, the film has a heart, the emotional scenes with his mother and the gut-wrenching loss he faces remind us why he became what he did.<br/><br/>From start to finish, I was fully locked in. 3 hours and 32 minutes felt like a rollercoaster of tension and triumph. The screenplay is tight, the performances are intense, and the music carries the soul of the film.<br/><br/>For me, this is the best movie I&#39;ve watched in years.

The story follows a bold, street-smart hero who never steps back when it comes to fighting injustice. From the opening sequence itself, the film establishes its mass attitude with larger-than-life heroism and punchy dialogues meant to excite fans who love high-voltage cinema.<br/><br/>The narrative is simple, built around social issues that many people can relate to. Instead of focusing on too many subplots, the screenplay keeps the mission of the protagonist clear: protect the weak and punish the corrupt. This makes the audience quickly connect with the hero&#39;s intentions, even if the story becomes predictable at times.<br/><br/>The lead actor is the biggest strength of Dhurandhar. His swag, emotional intensity, and comic timing keep the film entertaining throughout. Even routine scenes become enjoyable because of his strong presence. The heroine doesn&#39;t get much screen time, but she adds charm and contributes to a few feel-good romantic and comedy moments. The antagonist is powerful, with a good backstory and strong motives, which helps create a convincing clash between good and evil.<br/><br/>The first half is filled with fun comedy, stylish action scenes, and energetic songs. The interval twist successfully builds curiosity for what comes next. The second half focuses more on emotional drama and the hero&#39;s personal struggle. A few scenes feel lengthy and could have been trimmed, but the climax once again raises the energy with intense stunts and a meaningful message.<br/><br/>Technically, the film scores well. The background music enhances every action block. Cinematography captures both the mass crowds and emotional close-ups effectively.

rw11098078,surbhi-80,,Evoking past emotions of terror attacks,"Watching Dhurandhar was far more than a three-hour ride on a popular filmi rollercoaster where Akshaye Khanna&#39;s dancing or violence takes the spotlight. It was an emotional, heartfelt journey through three decades of terror incidents that anyone born in India in the 1980s has grown up witnessing. I was fortunate to have never been directly in harm&#39;s way-or, when I was, to have escaped unscathed-but the shadow of those attacks left deep, invisible scars, a constant undercurrent of fear that you never know when tragedy might strike.<br/><br/>The opening scene transported me straight back to the 1990s, to the Air India flight hijacking that ended at Kandahar. The hijackers demanded the release of terrorists, and the nation watched helplessly as Home Minister Jaswant Singh escorted them to comply. The tragedy of Ripin Katyal, a husband returning from his honeymoon, slashed and left to die in front of his wife, flashed vividly in my mind. Those moments, seen through the lens of news channels, left an entire nation frustrated, powerless, and questioning its ability to confront the unimaginable.<br/><br/>The IC 814 hijacking instilled in me a lifelong fear of flying. I later read the account by Captain Devi Sharan, whose description of what unfolds during a hijack cemented my unease. Since then, airports feel less like gateways to adventure and more like spaces where vigilance outweighs excitement; more than my passport, I scan my surroundings; more than the thrill of takeoff, I feel the anxious pull of &quot;what if?&quot;<br/><br/>The attack on the Indian Parliament was another stark reminder that safety is never guaranteed. While Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t attempt to depict every bomb blast that Delhi or Mumbai endured, it evokes the terror of those days. I recall leaving Sarojini Nagar market when a blast ripped through the crowded streets at peak hour. My mother&#39;s voice, trembling with fear upon seeing the news, still echoes in my memory. Simultaneously, a blast struck Karol Bagh, where my father usually spent his evenings. Phones went unanswered; my brother dashed through streets on his scooter. By sheer luck, my father returned home unharmed.<br/><br/>The film moves on to the Mumbai attacks of 26/11, recreating two harrowing days of terror broadcast live on Indian television. Pools of blood at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, bullets tearing through innocent lives, explosions in the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel-the horror played out in real-time, with media coverage sometimes inadvertently guiding the terrorists. Watching these scenes unfold on screen is chilling, not as fiction, but as a haunting echo of lived reality.<br/><br/>Perhaps Dhurandhar resonates so deeply not only because of its powerful performances but because it strikes a nerve with those of us who have lived through these moments. It reminds us of fear, loss, and the desperate hope that terror might one day be over. For many, it is more than a film; it is a mirror reflecting decades of collective trauma and the resilience to carry on with life.",0,

rw11010989,krharshsj,,"#DhurandharReview: A Razor-Sharp, Explosive Triumph - 4.5/5","Aditya Dhar doesn&#39;t just adapt real events - he weaponises them. Dhurandhar is a masterclass in connecting chillingly authentic dots from India&#39;s covert history - things we know and those we don&#39;t - and then draping them in blistering fiction so seamless that you&#39;ll spend the entire runtime wondering which parts Dhar pulled from classified files (and which &quot;great connections&quot; handed him the keys). Wink or not, the illusion is devastatingly effective.<br/><br/>This is lean, mean espionage cinema that refuses to waste a single second. No forced romance, no pointless subplots, no heroic monologues in the rain - just relentless forward momentum. The pacing is ferocious: never non-stop edge-of-the-seat (it breathes when it needs to), yet never, ever boring. When the bullets fly, the action is bone-crunching and brilliantly choreographed; when the silence falls, it&#39;s heavier than any explosion.<br/><br/>The score? An absolute beast - throbbing, patriotic, and cleverly laced with punchy callbacks to Sunny Deol&#39;s roaring 90s era (those remixed hooks hit like nostalgia grenades). If there&#39;s one minor gripe, it&#39;s that the sound mix occasionally lets the music drown out dialogue, but honestly, you&#39;ll be too pumped to care.<br/><br/>Acting is on a different planet. The legends on screen (you know exactly who they are) deliver performances that remind you why they&#39;re legends - raw power, zero vanity, total command. @RanveerOfficial fights valiantly, but he&#39;s comfortably overshadowed by the heavyweights around him.(@duttsanjay, Akshay Khanna @ActorMadhavan) Even smaller roles shine: Rakesh Bedi is a revelation, Sara Arjun carries her emotional track with startling maturity, and quiet fire.<br/><br/>Yet the night undeniably belongs to Aditya Dhar. From #Uri to this, he has perfected the art of building high-stakes thrillers on the skeleton of real incidents without ever letting the joins show. Every revelation feels earned, every twist organic, every emotional beat gut-punching. He turns potential mess into surgical precision.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar isn&#39;t just one of the best espionage films Bollywood has ever produced - it&#39;s a roaring statement that Aditya Dhar is operating on a level few can touch.<br/><br/>March 2026 sequel? Take my money now.<br/><br/>Verdict: 4.5/5 - Mandatory big-screen experience. Bring earplugs if you&#39;re sensitive to loud glory.",0,

rw11013425,SourikB-5,,Based fr,"The true measure of a masterpiece is its ability to defy expectations, and Dhurandhar achieves this by making its considerable runtime of over three hours feel remarkably fleet. It is a cinematic anomaly: a long cinema where, as the viewer, you might truly never know how the time passes. Director Aditya Dhar crafts an experience so immersive, the clock simply ceases to matter. For me it&#39;s a banger of 2025.<br/><br/>This is fundamentally an action thriller, but its lasting impact comes from its intellectual depth. You noted that everything about the film and every second of the script compliment each other, and this is the film&#39;s greatest triumph. It meticulously builds a complex web of geopolitics, personal trauma, and covert operations, where no plot thread feels wasted. This cohesive storytelling elevates the film beyond a simple revenge or rescue narrative.<br/><br/>The movie&#39;s aesthetics are fiercely compelling-it is unequivocally eye-popping. Yet, this spectacle is balanced by a subtle palate in the script&#39;s approach to moral complexity and the psychology of its characters. Ranveer Singh delivers a career-high performance of controlled intensity, perfectly complemented by the chilling, calculating restraint of Akshaye Khanna. Their confrontation grounds the grand scale in human stakes.<br/><br/>While some critics may point to the film&#39;s ambition stretching its length, Dhurandhar is a powerful, detailed, and engrossing epic. It&#39;s a patriotic action film that doesn&#39;t sacrifice intelligence for adrenaline. It is, without question, a must watch.",0,

Madhavan played a serious role which is very important for this movie.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal again proved that if you have given him a good role he can literally kill it.<br/><br/>And last but not the least, Sanjay Dutt played the role of the SP Chaudhary Aslam perfectly.<br/><br/>Kudos to Aditya Dhar for making this masterpiece and showing his vision for movie making.<br/><br/>The actual behind the scene hero is Shashwat Sachdev for giving plenty of good music with really well made BGMs and compositions.<br/><br/>Feeling grateful to see such versatility in music making.<br/><br/>Overall it&#39;s a must watch movie for all the cinematic or regular audience.<br/><br/>Waiting for next part eagerly.",0,
rw11017221,Maddy-055,,"Isn't just a film; it's a statement. A well-acted, tightly executed, and unforgettable one.","Dhurandhar arrives like a thunderclap, a film that refuses to blink in the face of geopolitical reality and instead delivers a gripping narrative with cinematic finesse. At the heart of the film stands Akshaye Khanna, whose performance is nothing short of extraordinary. He doesn&#39;t just act; he inhabits the frame with a calm ferocity, delivering a portrayal so controlled and layered that it becomes the emotional axis of the entire film. His presence elevates every scene, and his precision adds a gravity that lingers long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh brings an electric edge to his character, embodying both urgency and charisma with his trademark intensity. His role balances Khanna&#39;s stoic brilliance with a kinetic energy that keeps the film&#39;s pulse racing. Their dynamic together is one of the movie&#39;s most rewarding strengths.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal (my favorite actor), though given limited screen time, leaves a deep imprint. His performance is sharp and dignified, the kind that makes you wish the script had carved out more room for him. Even in a few scenes, he proves why he remains one of the industry&#39;s most compelling presences.<br/><br/>Beyond the performances, Dhurandhar stands out for its unapologetic commitment to truth-telling. The film boldly addresses Pakistan&#39;s support of terrorist organizations, presenting the narrative with clarity, research-backed nuance, and moral courage. It captures the geopolitical climate with an honesty rarely attempted in mainstream cinema, turning complex realities into powerful storytelling. Adding real footage from 26/11 and conversations between terrorists triangulated the truth claims made by the film.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar isn&#39;t just a film; it&#39;s a statement.

Akshaye Khanna ki screen presence mind-blowing - har frame mein ek unpredictable tension bana rehti hai.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal aur R. Madhavan jaise actors ne movie ko ek alag hi depth di hai. Inke characters supporting nahi lagte - sabka apna weight aur importance feel hota hai. Action sequences highly stylized hain, cinematography tight hai aur background score scenes ko aur bhi intense bana deta hai. Kuch jagah narrative slow ho jaata hai, lekin woh bhi story build karne ke liye zaroori lagta hai - fast pace hota toh shayad impact kam padta.<br/><br/>Story mein politics aur underworld ka mix har kisi ko suit na kare, but agar aapko gritty aur realistic tone pasand hai, toh Dhurandhar pakka pasand aayegi.

Not many films today dare to touch subjects this real and bold, especially when it comes to patriotism.

It says things many Indians have wanted to express but never felt comfortable saying out loud. Huge respect to Aditya Dhar for that brave attempt alone.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivered a controlled and mature performance - impactful without unnecessary exaggeration and completely aligned with the tone of the film.<br/><br/>The supporting cast collectively deserves appreciation. Saumya Tandon was a standout - she brought a calm strength and believable emotional depth that made her character genuinely felt.

Directed by Aditya Dhar, the film plunges audiences deep into the murky underworld of Karachi&#39;s mafia and the shadowy world of covert operations, borrowing from real-life events while weaving an intense fictional narrative.<br/><br/>One of the film&#39;s strengths is its ensemble cast. Alongside Ranveer Singh, actors like Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, R. Madhavan and Sara Arjun deliver solid performances that add weight and variety to the film&#39;s many layers. Critics and many viewers have particularly singled out Khanna&#39;s portrayal for offering a &quot;masterclass&quot; in villainy, while Ranveer plays a more subdued-but searing-spy whose moral compass and inner turmoil define much of the film&#39;s gravitas.<br/><br/>Visually and atmospherically, Dhurandhar excels. The film&#39;s world-building - its depiction of Karachi&#39;s underbelly, the cramped rooms, the smoky dens, the sense of paranoia and danger - feels immersive and convincing. The background score and sound design add to the tension and mood, often turning confrontations into thunderous cinematic moments.<br/><br/>But the film is not without flaws. Its runtime - around 3.5 hours - demands patience. The narrative occasionally falters: some sequences feel overly long, pacing dips in the second half, and certain violent or dramatic scenes verge on excess or rely on cinematic clichés that may strike some as heavy-handed or even jarring. Also, a few production limitations (notably in visual effects) and a sometimes predictable storyline keep it from being a flawless triumph.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a bold, often thrilling, occasionally exhausting cinematic ride - not just a movie, but a statement of scale. It&#39;s a film that asks a lot from its audience, yet gives back in tension, performances, and uncompromising ambition. For fans of gritty espionage thrillers and hard-hitting drama, it&#39;s a must-watch.",0,

It isn&#39;t just an action thriller, it&#39;s a brutal deep-dive into the raw, unfiltered underbelly of cross-border terror and pain, something our screens desperately needed.<br/><br/>After the shelving of his ambitious Ashwathama, perhaps Dhar unleashed years of bottled rage and truth onto the silver screen, birthing Dhurandhar, a larger-than-life juggernaut exposing ISI&#39;s brutal reality, flipping the script on typical spy thrillers that often paint them as reluctant allies.<br/><br/>This film draws from real-life events, even threading in archival footage, pressing every nerve of anguish connected to terrorism&#39;s scars on India.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s strength lies in its uncompromising realism.<br/><br/>The fragile romance, the gut-wrenching, hard-hitting action choreography that makes Kill look tame, the razor-sharp dialogues, all elevate Dhurandhar to legendary status.<br/><br/>No character is short-changed, be it the heroes or the villains. Rakesh Bedi&#39;s portrayal of a tenacious Pakistani politician who bites back adds a juicy, unexpected layer of venom.<br/><br/>Visually and audibly, it&#39;s a marvel.

Just the harsh truth of the conflict, presented with clarity.<br/><br/>Critics calling it &quot;propaganda&quot; are missing the point.

The film&#39;s protagonist, portrayed with magnetic intensity by the lead actor, delivers a performance that feels both grounded and transcendent.

The background score, subtle yet evocative, amplifies every emotional beat without ever overpowering it.

rw11017779,satendratomar-11687,,Perfect,"In an era where spy films often rely on over-the-top action sequences and implausible plot twists, Dhurandhar emerges as a masterclass in espionage cinema. This is not just a good spy film-it&#39;s the perfect spy film, executed with precision, intelligence, and an unwavering commitment to authentic storytelling.<br/><br/>From the opening frame, director establishes a world where trust is currency and deception is an art form. The film follows its protagonist through a labyrinth of double-crosses and shadowy allegiances, yet never loses sight of the human cost of living a life built on lies. What sets Dhurandhar apart is its refusal to reduce espionage to mere spectacle. Every scene serves the narrative, every conversation bristles with subtext, and every action sequence feels earned rather than obligatory.<br/><br/>The lead performance anchors the film with remarkable nuance. We see a spy who is simultaneously hunter and hunted, calculating yet vulnerable. The supporting cast matches this intensity, creating a web of characters where motivations remain gloriously ambiguous until the final act. You&#39;re never quite sure who&#39;s playing whom, and that uncertainty becomes the film&#39;s greatest asset.<br/><br/>Technically, Dhurandhar is flawless. The cinematography captures both the glamour and grime of the spy world, moving effortlessly from elegant embassy halls to rain-soaked backstreets. The score pulses with tension without overwhelming the drama, knowing when to amplify and when to retreat into silence. The editing is surgical, maintaining a rhythm that keeps you leaning forward without exhausting you.<br/><br/>What truly elevates Dhurandhar to perfection is its intelligence. The screenplay trusts its audience, weaving together multiple storylines with clockwork precision. Information is revealed strategically, rewarding attentive viewers while never becoming convoluted. The film understands that the best spy thrillers are puzzles where the audience plays along, piecing together clues alongside the characters.<br/><br/>The climax delivers a payoff that feels both surprising and inevitable-the hallmark of exceptional thriller writing. Without resorting to cheap tricks or last-minute revelations that betray earlier logic, Dhurandhar brings its intricate plot threads together in a finale that satisfies on every level.<br/><br/>In Dhurandhar, we finally have a spy film that honors the genre&#39;s legacy while feeling thoroughly contemporary. It&#39;s tense, intelligent, stylish, and emotionally resonant. For fans of espionage cinema, this isn&#39;t just recommended viewing-it&#39;s essential. This is how spy films should be made.",0,

rw11087230,rokokoio,,Absolute Cinematic,"Dhurandhar is a cinematic masterpiece that sets a new benchmark for filmmaking. Despite a runtime of 3 hours and 32 minutes, the film never feels long. Once it begins, time simply disappears.<br/><br/>Chapter 1: Story-Driven, Not Star-Driven<br/><br/>Unlike most spy films or &quot;superstar andhbhakt,&quot; Dhurandhar does not rely on star power. Yes, Ranveer Singh is a superstar, but here he is presented purely as an actor - nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>There is no aggressive star-centric marketing, no forced hero worship. The message is clear: watch the film for the experience, not for the star. This itself becomes one of the film&#39;s biggest strengths.<br/><br/>Chapter 2: &quot;Aman Shaanti&quot; Thrown in the Dustbin<br/><br/>Most spy films glamorize intelligence agencies - spies dancing in luxury clothes, romancing freely, and casually shaking hands with hostile organizations. Dhurandhar boldly rejects this fantasy.<br/><br/>The film shows the harsh reality of intelligence work while being careful not to generalize an entire nation. This balance is rare and mature, and it deserves appreciation.<br/><br/>Chapter 3: Spies Are Not Six-Pack Models<br/><br/>Since when did real spies need six-pack abs and designer goggles?<br/><br/>Take Ravindra Kaushik &quot;The Black Tiger of India&quot;. One of India&#39;s greatest spies, he didn&#39;t live a glamorous life. He lived away from his family, changed his identity for 10 years, and silently served the nation. That is real espionage.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar understands this reality and respects it ,and that&#39;s what makes it special.<br/><br/>Chapter 4: Low Testosterone = &quot;Asli Mard&quot;<br/><br/>This film is not hypermasculine, and that is exactly why it understands masculinity better than most movies today.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar shows how a man should be, not how cinema has conditioned us to believe a man must perform. There are two moments in the film where raw masculine energy is displayed - no shouting, no exaggeration, no theatrics. I won&#39;t name them, because those moments work precisely due to their restraint.<br/><br/>Our history is proof that true masculinity was never about noise or domination. It was about:
Control over oneself
Responsibility over ego
Silence when action is required
That same masculinity is reflected in Dhurandhar.<br/><br/>Not the artificial kind shown in films where men are constantly proving they are &quot;real men,&quot; but the grounded, disciplined masculinity that doesn&#39;t seek validation.<br/><br/>Modern cinema often mistakes aggression for manhood.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar reminds us that real men don&#39;t announce themselves - their actions do.<br/><br/>Chapter 5: &quot;Violence Se Mujhe Dard Ho Raha Hai&quot;<br/><br/>Yes, this film is violent - and yes, that violence is justified.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because it is not inflicted on civilians, not driven by religion, caste, or community. The violence in Dhurandhar is directed strictly towards those who actively work against humanity and global peace.<br/><br/>The wire-torture scene shown in the trailer is disturbing - but it is real. Such methods have existed. They have been used. And what the film shows is not even one percent of that reality.<br/><br/>If the full truth of espionage and interrogation had been portrayed honestly, it would have been impossible to digest for normal audiences.<br/><br/>This is not violence for shock value.<br/><br/>This is violence as context, as consequence, as a reminder that peace is often protected by people who live in moral grey zones.<br/><br/>Discomfort is intentional here - because reality is uncomfortable.",0,

It has single handedly brought back the thrill of a packed house and the shared energy of an audience.<br/><br/>Why It Works
The strength of this film lies in its honesty. While many modern films get lost in complex side plots or forced agendas, Dhurandhar stays true to its core.

It is a sprawling, uncompromising, and titan-sized epic that demands your attention and earns every second of its near four-hour runtime. This isn&#39;t just a movie; it is an evocative, visceral experience that redefines what mainstream Bollywood is capable of achieving.<br/><br/>THE ARCHITECTURE OF BRILLIANCE<br/><br/>The most staggering feat of Dhurandhar is its meticulous construction.

Arjun Rampal, in particular, delivers a turn so chilling it transcends traditional drama, veering into the territory of a high-end psychological horror.<br/><br/>WHY IT CHANGES EVERYTHING<br/><br/>This film is a declaration that the Indian audience is ready for intelligent writing and complex morality. By ditching the standard tropes for gritty, realistic action and slow-burn tension, it sets a brand new precedent. It is cinema in its purest, most potent form-a film that stays with you long after the lights come up, simmering in your mind and challenging your soul.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT: Dhurandhar is a towering achievement.

If you thought &quot;Uri: The Surgical Strike&quot; was the peak of modern Indian war films, get ready to have your mind blown. &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; is not just a movie; it is an experience that grabs you by the throat in the first minute and doesn&#39;t let go for 3 hours and 34 minutes.<br/><br/>1. Ranveer Singh is a Force of Nature
Forget the flamboyance; this is Ranveer stripped down to raw nerve and grit. He delivers a career-best performance that is haunting, intense, and terrifyingly real. You don&#39;t see the star; you only see the agent. His eyes speak volumes in the silent moments. This performance will be studied in acting schools.<br/><br/>2. The &quot;Avengers&quot; of Acting
The casting director deserves an award.<br/><br/>* Akshaye Khanna brings that sharp, intellectual intensity that only he can.<br/><br/>* R. Madhavan is chillingly brilliant.<br/><br/>* Arjun Rampal and Sanjay Dutt add a weight and menace that elevates the stakes.<br/><br/>Every time these titans share the screen, the tension is suffocating.<br/><br/>3.

The &#39;A&#39; rating is completely justified, and thank god for it! The action isn&#39;t the flying-car masala style; it is bone-crunching, bloody, and messy. It feels dangerous. You feel every punch and every bullet. It respects the audience&#39;s intelligence by showing the true cost of war and espionage.<br/><br/>4. A Masterclass in Direction
Aditya Dhar proves he is the best in the business when it comes to high-stakes thrillers. The pacing is miraculous-despite being nearly 3.5 hours long, there is not a single dull moment. The screenplay weaves complex history (IC-814, Parliament attacks) into a narrative that is easy to follow but emotionally heavy.<br/><br/>5. Technical Brilliance
The background score is thunderous yet emotional. The cinematography captures the gloom of the underworld and the dust of the battleground with equal beauty.<br/><br/>Verdict:

The pacing is tight, the tension is constant, and every scene pushes the story forward with purpose.<br/><br/>What really makes Dhurandhar powerful is how openly it links terror attacks on India to political decisions made during the UPA government era. The film presents a clear viewpoint, showing how weak policies, delayed decisions, and compromised national security frameworks created vulnerabilities that were later exploited by terrorist forces. It doesn&#39;t shy away from naming mistakes or questioning accountability, which gives the narrative a bold and unapologetic edge.<br/><br/>The screenplay is sharp and focused, with revelations that feel impactful rather than sensational. The direction ensures the message is delivered clearly while still maintaining the thrill of an espionage drama. Performances are intense and convincing, adding emotional weight to the political and security-related themes.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is more than just a thriller it&#39;s a hard-hitting political commentary wrapped in a gripping cinematic experience.

Aditya Dhar has proven himself once again; after Uri, he continues to show us what real cinema and true patriotism look like. Ignore the baseless negative reviews spreading online; this film is grounded in realism.<br/><br/>The Performances:
Ranveer Singh is back with a bang, proving his mettle once again. However, Akshaye Khanna, Bollywood&#39;s most underrated actor, completely steals the show. R. Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt, and Arjun Rampal are also at their absolute best.<br/><br/>The Music &amp; Rating:
The music is the heart of the film, ensuring it never feels boring despite the length.

Yes, a couple of unnecessary songs slow the tempo, but they never derail the core narrative.<br/><br/>What truly elevates Dhurandhar is its cast. Every major performer brings weight and conviction to their role, grounding the film&#39;s emotional undercurrent. The characters don&#39;t feel like stock archetypes they feel lived in, shaped by decades of pain, loss, and resilience. That authenticity is the film&#39;s strongest asset.<br/><br/>Beyond craft, Dhurandhar stands out for something larger: its willingness to present an uncompromised Indian perspective on the long history of suffering caused by cross-border terrorism. For decades, the country has witnessed the consequences of Pakistan-backed militant activities, and this film does not shy away from confronting that reality. It brings the narrative back to the victims, the families, the soldiers, and the ordinary people who have paid the price.<br/><br/>India needs more films like this stories that aren&#39;t afraid to articulate our own experiences and trauma, stories that depict our side of history with honesty and emotional clarity.

If this movie is being called &quot;time-pass&quot; or &quot;entertainment,&quot; then Indians should honestly be ashamed of a mentality that takes a completely fictional story as reality.

Ranveer Singh delivers a career-defining performance, seamlessly blending intensity and vulnerability. The supporting cast, especially the seasoned character actors, add depth to every scene, making the underworld feel disturbingly real. Director Dhar&#39;s vision is meticulous, crafting sequences that are as visually stunning as they are narratively significant.

Despite its massive runtime of nearly 3 hours 30 minutes, the film never feels exhausting-in fact, it feels too short. Stellar performances, tight direction, and a constantly escalating narrative keep the tension alive throughout. The film balances scale with substance, making every scene count. Dhurandhar isn&#39;t just watched; it&#39;s experienced-and when it ends, you&#39;re left wanting more.",0,
rw11018199,beluga69,,Dhurandhar - A Pulse-Pounding Masterpiece That Redefines the Spy Genre,"Forget everything you think you know about Indian spy thrillers-Dhurandhar isn&#39;t just another entry in the genre; it&#39;s a seismic shift. Directed with surgical precision by Aditya Dhar, this film merges raw realism with cinematic grandeur, delivering a story that&#39;s as emotionally resonant as it is relentlessly intense.<br/><br/>From the opening frame, Dhurandhar grips you with its authenticity. Shot with a documentary-like grit yet layered with poetic tension, the film weaves through shadowy terror networks, volatile gang rivalries, and moral gray zones-never once sacrificing heart for hype. The screenplay unfolds like a ticking time bomb: deliberate, coiled, and devastatingly effective. Each scene adds weight, not just to the plot, but to the souls of its characters.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a career-defining performance-transformative, restrained, and electrifying. He doesn&#39;t just play his character; he becomes him, erasing every trace of stardom to embody a man caught between duty and despair. The supporting cast is nothing short of phenomenal: Akshaye Khanna&#39;s chilling precision, Sanjay Dutt&#39;s weathered gravitas, Arjun Rampal&#39;s quiet intensity, and R. Madhavan&#39;s nuanced resolve all elevate the narrative. Even in brief appearances, actors like Sara Arjun and Manav Gohil leave lasting impressions-proof of the film&#39;s meticulous casting.<br/><br/>One sequence, in particular, lingers long after the credits: a harrowing attack rendered in blood-red hues, underscored by ghostly voice recordings that send shivers down your spine. It&#39;s bold, haunting, and emblematic of Dhar&#39;s fearless storytelling-where sound design, color, and silence speak as loudly as dialogue.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is more than a movie-it&#39;s an experience. Best watched in a dark theater with an audience holding its breath. And that ending? Pure cinematic bait. March 2026 can&#39;t come soon enough.<br/><br/>Verdict: 10/10 - Not just the best film of 2025 so far, but a new benchmark for Indian cinema.",0,
rw11013618,abhishekkumar-86904,,A must watch for everyone who wants to know how spy works,"Best Indian spy thriller till now, unlike the fake love story spy thrillers like ek tha tiger series or pathan.<br/><br/>Great direction showing all the details of terrorist country, which is based on true incidents which has happened inside india, and how a country retaliate.<br/><br/>Great performance by all the actor.",0,
rw11004937,Aman1SharmaJii,,"Style, Substance, and Sharp Storytelling","I watched Dhurandhar today, and honestly, it&#39;s a film that pulls you in slowly and then refuses to let go.<br/><br/>What really works in the film is the way the story moves forward chapter by chapter. Each character is introduced with care, and their backstories are given enough time to breathe. That buildup pays off, because as the film progresses, the plot becomes more intense and aggressive in its own quiet way.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna is the real star of the show. His performance is restrained, sharp, and deeply engaging-he owns every scene he&#39;s in. Ranveer Singh, on the other hand, is decent but familiar. There are shades of his earlier work, especially Padmaavat. That said, his emotional moments are strong, and he delivers well when the film demands intensity.<br/><br/>The theatre experience adds a lot to the vibe. The background score, the retro songs, and the overall sound design hit the right notes and elevate many scenes. Sanjay Dutt&#39;s character, however, feels a bit repetitive. It&#39;s a role we&#39;ve seen him play before-the tough, authoritative figure-and it doesn&#39;t offer much that&#39;s new.<br/><br/>A big surprise for me was the Pakistan-set portions. Among all the characters, Arjun Rampal stands out with the most convincing accent. He isn&#39;t perfect in every scene, but his consistency makes a difference. R. Madhavan is another major highlight. As the narrator, he brings depth and calm to the storytelling. His subtle hints toward the idea of a &quot;new India&quot; reflect Aditya Dhar&#39;s worldview, something we&#39;ve seen in his previous work as well.<br/><br/>The post-credit scene is a treat and leaves a strong impact. And the final fight sequence featuring Ranveer Singh is completely unexpected it&#39;s raw, intense, and adds a powerful closing note to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a well-packaged theatrical experience with strong performances, a gripping narrative style, and moments that stay with you after the credits roll. It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s engaging, confident, and definitely worth watching on the big screen.",0,
rw11065103,avinash-hedaoo24,,Thunderous cinematic experience,"Dhurandhar is a thunderous cinematic experience that grips you from the first frame and never loosens its hold.

Stylish yet grounded action set pieces elevate the film&#39;s energy. Each sequence is choreographed with clarity and impact, serving the story rather than overpowering it.<br/><br/>🎶 Music &amp; Technical Brilliance

A wonderful performance by Ranbeersinh, Akshay Khanna , Sanjay Datt , A. Rampal and a pretty lady heroign plus all most all did lethal job descently. Some where even better / equivalent to Western Hollywood stunts. Do not miss. Actors get up is slightly hinting the current personality so the reactions actually serve publicity... The film is Running high... and see the trick. Balochistan and Western Punjab Muslims are not tuned well. A Baloch Sardar is used..

I had loved URI and liked Article 370 (produced by URI and Dhurandhar&#39;s director Aditya Dhar). The runtime of the movie and the controversies surrounding it only served to lower my expectations further.<br/><br/>Amazingly, this is one of the finest written and executed action-spy movies; if not the finest; bollywood has given us in the past decade.<br/><br/>Each character is written and developed in a way that makes you connect with them. You feel for them. The story is presented through chapters, and each chapter does a fantastic job of tying the narrative together as a whole.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh was excellent in the movie, but for me personally, Akshaye Khanna stole the show. A once in a generation performance from him.<br/><br/>Acting ranking:
Akshaye Khanna &gt; Ranveer Singh &gt; R. Madhavan &gt; Arjun Rampal &gt; Sanjay Dutt
You know your movie is packed with acting powerhouses when even the weakest performance among the leads still comes from Sanju Baba.<br/><br/>The writing, direction, acting, cinematography, sound design, action (holy gore!), and almost everything else you can think of are outstanding. Despite being this awesome, the film will still entertain you more than any other Bollywood release this year.<br/><br/>Negatives (at least the few there are):

The film never feels lengthy; every scene keeps you glued to your seat and fully engaged throughout.<br/><br/>The direction and acting are exceptional. The movie powerfully highlights real incidents involving the Congress/UPA government and its failure to take decisive action during critical moments such as the circulation of counterfeit Indian currency and the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. It portrays how the government was ineffective in ruling the country and appeared to sympathize with terrorists instead of acting firmly in the nation&#39;s interest.<br/><br/>Hats off to Aditya Dhar for making such a hard-hitting film that opens the eyes of Indians.

rw11016574,ArvantP,,Must Watch Movie,"Aditya Dhar&#39;s Dhurandhar after URI and Baramulla, honestly feels like the best spy movie India has produced in years. It isn&#39;t loud, flashy, or cartoonish like the Pathan, Tiger, War universe; instead, it is grounded, sharp and terrifyingly close to real life. The film shows how intelligence officers actually think, plan, make mistakes, recover, and put their lives on the line for the country. What impressed me most was how the movie connects every mission with real-world tensions, cross-border infiltration, and the emotional pressure our agents carry. It highlights the cruelty and brutality performed by extremist terrorist groups against innocent Indian citizens, without unnecessary exaggeration. The scenes of captives, bomb factories, and hidden bases feel painfully real, and Akshaye Khanna&#39;s calm intensity mixed with Ranveer Singh&#39;s raw energy makes the narrative even more gripping. Their performances feel less like acting and more like they are living the mission especially in the interrogation sequences and the final infiltration scene.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is that it respects the idea of a spy thriller. Instead of turning heroes into superheroes like in Pathan, Tiger, or War, this film shows strategy instead of slow-motion, intelligence instead of random action, and purpose instead of just style. When Ranveer silently tracks a terror cell through the narrow lanes or Akshaye Khanna breaks down the enemy network using pure mind power, you feel the tension in your stomach. The movie also doesn&#39;t shy away from exposing the dark realities of cross-border extremist groups operating from Pakistan, how they manipulate young minds, and the inhuman torture methods they use. But the film is careful it targets terrorists, not ordinary people, and that realism makes the story more powerful. The last 30 minutes are enough to make you sit frozen in your seat, thinking about the sacrifices made by the unseen heroes of India. For me, &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; is not just a spy movie; it is a reminder of a world we choose not to see, and a tribute to the people who protect us without asking for credit. A full 10/10 from my side.",0,
rw11004902,harshawasthi90,,Best Spy Movie Bollywood has ever offered.,"The film runs for 3.5 hours, yet not for a moment does it lose momentum. It holds your attention with an almost hypnotic grip.<br/><br/>Special praise for the BGM. The way it blends with the narrative rhythm, and the way it rises and recedes with the tension, is genuinely masterful.<br/><br/>Outstanding performances
Most compelling performances, in order:<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal - Major Iqbal
Jameel Jamali - Jameel Jamali
Akshaye Khanna - Rehman Dakait
Ranveer Singh - Hamza Ali Mazhari
Madhavan - Ajay Sanyal<br/><br/>The tight close-up shots, especially the ones capturing Ranveer Singh&#39;s micro-expressions, are brilliantly executed.<br/><br/>The production design feels remarkably authentic. Even the green-screen sequences have a level of realism rarely seen in mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>What I particularly appreciate is the film&#39;s unapologetic portrayal of Pakistan and the ISI.<br/><br/>This is a refreshing change from the sanitised, commercially driven crap seen in Jawan, Ek Tha Tiger, and similar franchises.<br/><br/>When the film ended,
it genuinely caught me off-guard.<br/><br/>It felt as though I did not want it to finish, because the rising momentum had created such an immersive flow.<br/><br/>Please watch it.<br/><br/>Support it.<br/><br/>Make it a blockbuster,<br/><br/>so that more filmmakers gain the confidence to attempt bold and uncompromising storytelling.<br/><br/>Improvements I felt..
1. Action sequences could be shorter and more grounded.<br/><br/>2. Romantic songs can be avoided to maintain the narrative flow.<br/><br/>3. Movies should have ended on an unresolved moment,

rw11018359,AnubhavM-05,,This is the perfect way to expose Atankistan.,"The story is set against the backdrop of real historical events, specifically the 1999 IC-814 Kandahar hijacking and the 2001 Indian Parliament attack. Following these attacks, Indian intelligence chief Ajay Sanyal (played by R. Madhavan and loosely based on Ajit Doval) decides that India needs to stop playing defense. He devises a long-term covert operation to infiltrate the &quot;terror factory&quot; inside Pakistan.<br/><br/>The Mission: Operation Dhurandhar
Sanyal recruits a young prisoner with no family and a violent past named Jaskirat Singh Rangi (Ranveer Singh). Sanyal trains him to become a lethal &quot;weapon&quot; and gives him a new identity: Hamza Ali Mazari.<br/><br/>Hamza is sent to Lyari, a notorious neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, known for its gang wars. His mission is to infiltrate the local underworld, which is being used by the Pakistani state (ISI) to fund and organize terror attacks against India.<br/><br/>Infiltration &amp; Rise
Hamza manages to join the gang of Rehman Dakait (Akshaye Khanna), a feared Balochi gangster who wants to transition into a legitimate political leader. Hamza wins Rehman&#39;s trust by saving his family and proving his loyalty. Over time, Hamza rises through the ranks to become Rehman&#39;s right-hand man.<br/><br/>While deep undercover, Hamza navigates a complex web of power:
Rehman Dakait: The gangster with political ambitions.<br/><br/>**Jameel Jamali (Rakesh Bedi): A corrupt politician using the gangs for votes.<br/><br/>**Major Iqbal (Arjun Rampal): An ISI officer who orchestrates terror plots against India using the gang&#39;s resources.<br/><br/>**SP Chaudhry Aslam (Sanjay Dutt): A ruthless Pakistani cop (the &quot;Encounter Specialist&quot;) trying to clean up Lyari, who becomes a major obstacle for Hamza and Rehman.<br/><br/>The Turning Point
Hamza falls in love with Yalina (Sara Arjun), the daughter of the politician Jameel Jamali, complicating his mission. However, the emotional core of the movie shifts during the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. Hamza is forced to watch helplessly as his &quot;bosses&quot; in Pakistan celebrate the attacks on his homeland. This fills him with rage and solidifies his resolve to destroy the network from within.<br/><br/>Ending Explained
The Betrayal
The climax sees the lines between loyalty and duty blur. Hamza uses the conflict between the police (SP Chaudhry Aslam) and the gangsters to his advantage. Although Hamza has built a brotherhood with Rehman Dakait, his duty to India comes first.<br/><br/>After Rehman is injured in a confrontation with SP Aslam, Hamza takes him to safety-only to reveal his true allegiance. In a heart-wrenching scene, Hamza kills Rehman Dakait, fulfilling the first major step of his mission. This is significant because he has to kill the man who treated him like a brother to serve his country.<br/><br/>The Cliffhanger
The movie does not end with a &quot;happily ever after.&quot; After killing Rehman, Hamza returns to his cover life. In the final scene, he is seen looking at a secret diary/list of targets. Rehman Dakait was just the first name. He crosses it out, revealing the next major target: Major Iqbal (the ISI officer).<br/><br/>The film ends with the promise of Dhurandhar Part 2 (slated for March 2026), where Hamza will likely go after the state-sponsored actors (ISI) directly.<br/><br/>Real-Life Inspirations
The movie is a fictionalized account but draws heavily from reality:
Hamza Ali Mazari: A fictional deep-cover agent.<br/><br/>Ajay Sanyal: Based on India&#39;s National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval.<br/><br/>Rehman Dakait: Based on the real-life Lyari gangster Rehman Dakait, who was a central figure in the Karachi gang wars.<br/><br/>SP Chaudhry Aslam: Based on Chaudhry Aslam Khan, a real Pakistani police officer known for his encounters against terrorists and gangsters.",0,

rw11016381,VishalsinhZala-8,,This is what cinema should be RAW & REAL,"Dhurandhar is a film that stands apart from most modern spy thrillers because of one simple reason - its rawness. Unlike the glossy, over-stylized, over-dramatic movies like Pathaan or Tiger 3, this film doesn&#39;t try to sell fantasy. It doesn&#39;t hide behind unnecessary glamour, childish heroism, or diplomatic sugar-coating. Instead, Dhurandhar presents a world that feels brutally real, emotionally heavy, and disturbingly close to what an actual covert operation might look like.<br/><br/>What I appreciated the most is how the movie handles the portrayal of geopolitical tension. It doesn&#39;t pretend that everything is rosy between neighbouring nations. It doesn&#39;t create fake friendship arcs or forcefully show the enemy country as &quot;good&quot; just to make the plot politically correct. Instead, it shows the harsh mindset, hostility, and underground operations that exist in the world of intelligence. The movie doesn&#39;t generalize people - it targets the systems, organizations, and power structures that fuel conflict. And in that sense, the film hits with a level of truthfulness that mainstream spy films usually avoid.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh&#39;s performance adds a layer of intensity that makes you feel the danger and brutality of espionage. His character isn&#39;t a superhero - he bleeds, breaks, doubts, and still fights. The film&#39;s atmosphere remains dark, realistic, and grounded from start to end, without jumping into unrealistic stunts or cringe dialogues seen in many commercial spy movies.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of Dhurandhar is its commitment to authenticity. The cinematography, locations, interrogations, military operations, and emotional stakes are all built with a sense of reality, not Bollywood-style exaggeration. It creates tension that feels earned and situations that feel possible.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a gripping, unapologetically real spy thriller that refuses to compromise its truth for entertainment. If you prefer grounded storytelling over flashy nonsense, this movie is absolutely worth watching.",0,

Sandeep Reddy Vanga&#39;s &quot;Animal&quot; is not just a film; it is a seismic event in Indian cinema. It is a &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; entry in the genre of crime dramas-bold, bloody, and brutally intense. At its core, the movie is a twisted father-son saga, but wrapped in layers of hyperbolic violence and toxic masculinity that refuse to apologize for their existence.<br/><br/>Ranbir Kapoor delivers the performance of a lifetime. As Ranvijay, he is terrifyingly calm yet explosively violent, shedding his chocolate-boy image for something far darker. His transformation from a neglected son to an obsessive protector is chilling. Anil Kapoor brings a weary gravity to the role of the father, while Bobby Deol, despite limited screen time, leaves a haunting impact as the mute antagonist.<br/><br/>The background score is thunderous, elevating the action sequences into operatic chaos. However, the film is not without flaws. The runtime is punishing, and the screenplay occasionally drags under its own weight. Critics may argue the morality is questionable, but as a piece of cinema, it is undeniable. &quot;Animal&quot; is a wild, untamed beast that roars loud enough to shake the foundations of Bollywood.<br/><br/>Would you like me to write a review for a different specific movie or in a specific style (e.g., funny, critical)?",0,

Unlike other films that try to balance the narrative by showing &quot;good people on both sides&quot; or romanticizing the enemy for the sake of diplomacy, Dhurandhar has the guts to call a spade a spade. It doesn&#39;t sugarcoat the enemy&#39;s intent. There is no forced romance track diverting from the mission. Ranveer&#39;s character, Hamza, isn&#39;t there to sing songs, he is there to dismantle a terror network from the inside. Instead of gravity defying bike jumps, we get actual tradecraft infiltration, encryption, silence, and the suffocating pressure of being undercover in Karachi. The tension in the 26/11 sequences is more heart pounding than any CGI explosion.

Living among gangsters, criminals, and power-hungry leaders, Hamza must carefully earn their trust while secretly working to stop a rising terror operation.

The action scenes are extraordinary yet believable, and the performances bring a strong emotional weight to the narrative.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a powerful, fast-paced thriller that delivers both heart and heavy realism-an absolutely compelling watch.",0,

I am not sure how many times I might have watched URI. Article 370 another great movie from him. One thing I can say if any war movies or Spy movies are made I like Aditya to do so with an ultimate story telling and direction.<br/><br/>Now in regards to movie, it showed how the events generally occurred through terrorism and how each of us are affected by that.<br/><br/>One remain engaged fully in the movie with great action scenes(some scenes are not suitable for children under age 16), chase and solid music.<br/><br/>A must watch movie based on true events, unlike a YRF spyverse with no head and tail and always portraying ISI in a good way working with RAW to save India from evil forces.",0,
rw11027585,monikaprasadroy,,"Heavy, Haunting, and Impossible to Ignore","You know a film is compelling - truly a banger meant for an intelligent audience - when the experience inside the theatre itself becomes a statement.<br/><br/>When people are already seated well before the film begins, not because they were early, but because they didn&#39;t want to miss a second. When not a single phone rings, no screens light up, no restless scrolling - just collective stillness. When no one gets up, not even once, not for water, not for comfort, not for distraction - even as legs go numb and time stretches. When there&#39;s no cross-talk, no commentary, no casual reactions, because everyone is too absorbed to speak. You know it&#39;s working when the only sounds in the theatre are sharp gasps, involuntary screams, and silence so heavy it presses on your chest - especially during those brutal scenes where it almost feels like the audience itself is enduring the pain on screen.<br/><br/>That&#39;s what Dhurandhar does.<br/><br/>From the very first shot, the film doesn&#39;t ease you in - it pulls you under. There&#39;s no warm-up, no cushioning. You&#39;re submerged immediately, watching continuously, without blinking, without relief. Time becomes irrelevant. Three and a half hours pass, your body protests, your legs go numb - and yet you don&#39;t flinch for even a second, because the screen refuses to loosen its grip.<br/><br/>The background score and songs are absolute bangers - not decorative, not loud for effect, but perfectly timed, one after the other, amplifying tension, dread, rage, and inevitability. The music doesn&#39;t tell you what to feel - it locks you into it.<br/><br/>What&#39;s remarkable is how long it takes to realise what kind of film you&#39;re watching.<br/><br/>At some point - much later - it hits you:
this is a villain-driven movie.<br/><br/>And even more unsettling - the villains are the main characters.<br/><br/>The film doesn&#39;t announce this. It lets you discover it slowly, uncomfortably, once you&#39;re already emotionally invested. That delayed realisation is part of its brilliance.<br/><br/>There are moments that don&#39;t just disturb - they linger physically.<br/><br/>Your blood boils.<br/><br/>Your throat tightens.<br/><br/>You unexpectedly shed a tear or two.<br/><br/>The Kandahar attack sequence - the neck slicing - is horrifying not because it&#39;s graphic, but because it&#39;s matter-of-fact, stripped of dramatics. The torture sequence involving Arjun Rampal isn&#39;t sensational - it&#39;s procedural, controlled, and therefore far more unsettling. And the 26/11 audio recordings playing against a red screen - that moment doesn&#39;t scream at you. It haunts you.<br/><br/>What makes Dhurandhar successful isn&#39;t just scale, performances, or technical finesse. It&#39;s the way it demands attention and then earns it completely. It trusts its audience to sit with discomfort, to process moral ambiguity, to endure silence, brutality, and restraint without spoon-feeding emotion.<br/><br/>This is not a film you casually watch.<br/><br/>It&#39;s a film you experience collectively, in a theatre, in silence, in tension, in shared unease.<br/><br/>And when the lights come back on, you don&#39;t walk out buzzing or cheering.<br/><br/>You walk out quieter. Heavier. Still processing.<br/><br/>That&#39;s how you know it worked.",0,

The screenplay is tight, the pacing steady, and the atmosphere consistently intense. The film avoids simplistic patriotism and instead presents espionage as a world of moral ambiguity, personal sacrifice, and psychological pressure.<br/><br/>The lead actor delivers one of his finest performances-controlled, layered, and convincingly sharp as a field operative trained to think several steps ahead.

The cinematography captures the covert world with muted tones and shadowy interiors, while the background score elevates moments of suspense without overpowering them. Action sequences are grounded and realistic, staying true to the genre.<br/><br/>If the film falters anywhere, it is in a few predictable story beats and an overlong second act. However, the final payoff is satisfying, with a climax that feels both thrilling and emotionally resonant.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandar stands out as an engaging spy thriller that combines geopolitical realism with cinematic flair.

Film was fantastic .. a 3.5 hr film that keeps u hooked from start to end .. kuch toh hoga na .. Aditya Dhar .. hats off to u bro .. grt film indeed ..
Quentin Tarantino ka chaap dikhayi deta hai isme, yet retaining its regional identity 👌👌.<br/><br/>Abt the Akshaye vs Ranveer hype ... All bullshit according to me. Both actors have held their own and r brilliant in their own right!! 👌👍
.. each having their own space in the film with extremely well written characters. No one overshadows the other in any form. Sab bakwaas hai !!<br/><br/>The film is much more than just these 2 characters..
Rakesh Bedi as the devious politician, Sanjay Dutt as the encounter specialist cop , Arjun Rampal as the ISI chief whose hatred for India sends a shiver down ur spine, R Madhavans portrayal of Ajit Doval and Gaurav Gera as Ranveers handler in Pak - each and every one has given it their all to make it a memorable watch.<br/><br/>Now abt my misadventure.. going with the flow ,i had booked my tickets for 7th Dec and enthusiastically went to the cinema hall to watch it.<br/><br/>Upon reaching the cinema hall ( PVR cinemas at Phoenix Market City, Viman Nagar) i found out to my shock and horror that I had , in haste, booked tickets for PVR cinemas, at Phoenix Mall of the Millennium in Wakad , the other side of town instead 😁 ..

After a while, you stop seeing &quot;Ranveer the star&quot; and start seeing a man who looks dangerous, unpredictable, and mentally ten steps ahead of everyone else. His eyes do half the acting - cold, sharp, and unsettling - and that&#39;s what makes the character stick.<br/><br/>The hype isn&#39;t just about action or scale; it&#39;s about how restrained yet explosive he feels. When he finally snaps, it hits harder because of the calm he carries before it. This role reminds people why Ranveer is considered one of the most fearless performers of his generation - he doesn&#39;t play safe, he commits fully.

The movie is supposed to be lengthy but when you&#39;re in the theatre watching the movie, you don&#39;t even realise when the 3.34 hours were up. The movie got the entire theatre whooping &amp; cheering at the end. It tells you how crisp and perfect the direction &amp; narration were. Some of the real life events that Dhar cleverly interwove with the story was honestly beautiful. It hits you hard. How much we have lost. How many lives were lost especially because of our own people. While the direction is clearly the star of the movie, the actors are not far behind. Ranveer Singh proved yet again why he&#39;s the most versatile actor of his generation. He proved yet again how he is an actor with a calibre no other current generation or his can come close to. Especially in the first half, the character needs subtlety &amp; patience. He delivers so well. You only see Hamsa on the screen throughout. Madhavan, Akshay &amp; Arjun were each terrific in the respective roles that they play. Each of their characters get an arc and a story that they don&#39;t feel like side characters which is also something Aditya did well. The movie does so well to not just tell the story &amp; sacrifice behind every single brave heart that sacrifice everything for the country but he does it in a way that keeps the audience engaged &amp; invested.

Still, I went in with an open mind and I&#39;m glad I did.<br/><br/>The film lands because it dares to show a truth that many prefer not to see.

rw11026441,raja-mishra7,,"A gripping, grounded Espionage Masterpiece that finally lets its spies blend in, its villains feel real.","Dhurandhar is built on a genre I care about deeply: the serious spy thriller - closer to Body of Lies or The Departed than to the usual glossy &quot;RAW loves ISI anti-hero&quot; template that Hindi cinema keeps recycling.<br/><br/>For years, our films have been oddly shy about showing Pakistan&#39;s deep-state ecosystem for what it is.<br/><br/>We either romanticise it, or soften key players into &quot;good at heart but misguided&quot; figures at the very top of a security apparatus that, in reality, has been repeatedly linked to terror networks. Dhurandhar, very deliberately, refuses that soft focus. It treats the Pakistani establishment and its proxies with a cold, clinical lens, while still keeping the story accessible to a mainstream audience. That alone makes it feel like a generational correction.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. At three and a half hours, the film is long on runtime but still feels rushed in parts, as if it&#39;s constantly jumping from frame to frame rather than letting some moments breathe. There is enough material here for three films instead of two, and you can sense that density in how quickly some arcs are wrapped.<br/><br/>Where it really shines is in the writing. The core script and screenplay are sharply structured: real-life antagonists and events are woven with fictional protagonists in a way that feels disturbingly plausible. The Lyari gang wars give the film its spine. We see just enough of that brutality to understand the stakes and the moral rot, but the director stops short of Game of Thrones level gore. That restraint is not timidity; it&#39;s craft.<br/><br/>The direction, overall, is of genuinely international standard. Compressing a brutal, politically loaded reality into one contained narrative, keeping the context clear and the emotional throughline intact across such a long film, is no small feat. The filmmaker has already proved himself with Uri, and this only underlines that he is a craftsperson to track very closely.<br/><br/>The casting is interesting, and uneven.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan is superb as Sanyal, clearly inspired by someone the whole nation really admires. It&#39;s technically a cameo, but he walks in with such quiet authority that the character feels much larger than his screen time.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh&#39;s work here is more complicated to talk about. On the surface, he doesn&#39;t &quot;stand out&quot; - and that is exactly why he works as a spy. If your undercover operative is constantly dancing, showing off, and drawing attention, he&#39;s failing at the job. Dhurandhar does something almost embarrassingly obvious yet rarely done in our cinema: it remembers that spies are meant to disappear into the crowd, not turn espionage into a spectacle. Ranveer leans into that idea. When he is in the backdrop, thinking more than speaking, you get a glimpse of a credible field operative who relies on brain over brute force or CGI heroics. At the same time, his innate screen presence is undeniable; it&#39;s rare among current &quot;stars,&quot; and he remains, purely on craft and range, one of the finest actors of his generation. The jarring contrast, of course, is between that disciplined performance and his often chaotic, attention-seeking public persona - but on screen, in this film, the work holds.<br/><br/>Sara Arjun is competent and does what the part asks, but the romantic or emotional chemistry with Ranveer never fully catches fire. It&#39;s not bad - just oddly flat for what the story could have supported and you will sense that it is not the age-gap that has caused the lapse.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt, for me, is the weak link. He physically resembles the real-world figure he&#39;s based on, which helps, but the performance feels undercooked. You keep wishing someone like Kumud Mishra had been cast instead; he could have brought the same menace with far more nuance.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal and Rakesh Bedi are both on point. Rampal has an ominous, slow-burn presence that clearly sets him up for a larger role in the sequel. Bedi does lecherous and morally greasy exactly the way the part demands, without drifting into caricature.<br/><br/>Danish Pandor is convincing in the limited time he gets. The casting for the Uzair Baloch counterpart is smart: you can see the foundation being laid for a much heavier load in the next film, and he seems ready to carry it.<br/><br/>The show-stealer, though, is Akshaye Khanna. This is his second standout villain turn in the same year, and Dhurandhar cements his comeback. If you don&#39;t know the real man he&#39;s playing, you could believe Khanna is that person. If you do know the reference, you&#39;re still likely to feel he rocked in the role. With very few lines, and a performance built almost entirely on body language, gaze, and timing, he reminds you just how refined an actor of the previous generation he really is.<br/><br/>The craft around the performances is equally solid. The songs and background score are excellent, and the BGM in particular does heavy lifting in tension and mood. Production design is both era-appropriate and class-appropriate - a chronic weakness in many Hindi films. The rich have the kind of high-end gadgets they would plausibly own; street-level characters use basic, believable devices. Nothing feels randomly &quot;fancy&quot; for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The film leaves a lot unsaid and unexplained. Some of that is clearly by design, to hold material back for the next instalment. Some of it feels like a casualty of the already massive runtime.<br/><br/>And then there are the &quot;usual&quot; accusations that get thrown at any unapologetically pro-India narrative.<br/><br/>Is Dhurandhar jingoistic? Not really. If anything, it is far more restrained than the label suggests. There are no chest-thumping speeches, barely any melodramatic breakdowns. The patriotism is mostly in the choices characters make, not in slogans shouted at the camera.<br/><br/>Does it show &quot;too much&quot; Pakistan and &quot;not enough&quot; India? The story is literally about an Indian spy infiltrating a Pakistani gang in one of Karachi&#39;s most notorious spaces. Of course most of the visual canvas is Pakistan. Expecting equal visual time for India here is like complaining that a submarine film shows too much water. If you want pretty postcards of Indian cities, that&#39;s what travel videos are for. This film is about the underbelly across the border.<br/><br/>Is it &quot;anti-secular&quot; because it portrays a mostly Muslim gang in Pakistan as violent and regressive? That criticism skips the basic context: this is not a random community portrait. It&#39;s about gangsters who, in the real world, have been tied to multiple terror incidents. Sanitising them into misunderstood soft anti-heroes would be far more dishonest than showing them as dangerous.<br/><br/>Is it &quot;too violent&quot;? By most expert accounts of Lyari and similar spaces, what&#39;s on screen is perhaps a fraction of the real brutality. Dhurandhar shows enough to disturb, but not enough to numb. That is a conscious artistic choice.<br/><br/>Finally, the film refuses the usual commercial distractions: there are no item numbers parachuted into the plot, no bikini songs on foreign beaches that pause the story for choreography. Real operatives in the field usually live hard, compromised lives; they are not pausing mid-mission for a music video. Dhurandhar respects that reality and, in doing so, respects the audience&#39;s intelligence.<br/><br/>By the end of the year, taken together with Chaava, this stands as one of the strongest Hindi films in the mainstream space - and it&#39;s no coincidence that Akshaye Khanna is central to both. Dhurandhar may be imperfect and occasionally overstuffed, but it does one simple, essential thing that our cinema has been avoiding for years: it uses common sense about what spies are supposed to do - blend in, not perform - and builds a gripping, politically clear story around that truth.",0,

Yes, the film is long... very long at 212 minutes. But those 212 minutes are pure madness.<br/><br/>The writing is top-tier, even if the pacing wobbles occasionally. What really surprised me is that Dhar refuses to take the usual espionage-thriller route. There&#39;s no cheap &quot;what&#39;s next?&quot; tension-building. Instead, he goes for a gritty, documentary-style tone ; dark, heavy, and brutally honest. The colour palette is gloomy, the lighting is fascinating, and the cinematography is just wild. Sashwat&#39;s music lifts the film several notches. And the violence? At times, it&#39;s genuinely hard to watch. This is brutality at its peak.<br/><br/>The characters are written with real weight.

rw11028828,SamkitJ-1,,Dhurandhar review,"Dhurandhar is one of those rare Bollywood films where the craft genuinely rises above everything else. What impressed me most is that the movie is not carried by just one performance. Akshaye, Rampal, Sanjay, Ranveer - everyone comes in with the presence of a lead, and together they hold the film with remarkable balance. Ranveer plays his part exactly the way it should be played, without overshadowing the world the film is trying to create.<br/><br/>The real achievement, though, is how the film rises beyond individual actors. It reminds me of how Pacino in The Godfather or De Niro in Casino and Goodfellas are remembered not just because of their acting but because they were part of films that were masterpieces in themselves. When a movie reaches that level, the film and the performances become inseparable.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar manages to achieve that with Dhurandhar.

rw11045995,anandkumarrs,,"A well made, engaging spy story","Anand Kumar R. S My Flash Review:
Dhurandhar is scripted, directed, and produced by Aditya Dhar, whose earlier directorial outing was Uri: The Surgical Strike. If the &quot;Josh levels&quot; were high in that film, Dhar takes them even higher in Dhurandhar. Although the film opens with a long disclaimer stating it is purely a work of fiction, most viewers can tell that it is largely based on real events, accounts, and people. For those closely following current affairs, the events depicted in the film are easy to relate to and therefore engaging.<br/><br/>Any commentary on the film is difficult without mentioning its length. The film runs for 3.5 hours, and this is only Part 1. A sequel is scheduled for release by March 2026. With such a lengthy film, it is a significant challenge for the creators to keep viewers engaged throughout, and in this regard, I would say it is a mixed bag. The screenplay mostly keeps us engaged, but there are moments when it struggles to hold our attention, only to regain it later. The ability to stage a comeback when the film begins to lag is one of the film&#39;s strong points.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar clearly belongs to the spy thriller genre, but is entirely different from the &#39;Pathan, War, Ek Tha Tiger&#39; types of spy thrillers. Because it is based on real events, it is more intense, with a raw storytelling style. The film is structured as chapters, and in the first chapter itself, the director sets the context: Pakistan-backed terrorists are repeatedly involved in attacks in India, such as the IC 814 hijack and the Parliament attack. Yet, India is unable to stop these through dialogue or Aman ki Asha efforts and therefore decides to resort to covert operations. This decision follows an impactful scene inside the hijacked aircraft at Kandahar when the IB Chief shouts Bharat Mata ki, but meets with an eerie silence.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh plays Hamza, an undercover operative planted in Pakistan to gather intelligence on its terror plans. He joins a powerful mafia gang, and until the interval, we are immersed in intergang rivalry, the politician-mafia nexus, and the ISI&#39;s scheming. These parts are quite different and feel very realistic. The first half of the film runs for two hours, and the director tries to fit too much into it. As a result, the watch feels somewhat tiring, but the second half becomes sleeker and more engaging.<br/><br/>The film scores very high on craft and making. It is, to a large extent, an action film, and the action set pieces are brilliantly executed. For example, the action sequence in the climax inside a moving car, I thought, was very well shot. Vikash Nowlakha is the cinematographer, and his work is top-notch. It seems that, except for the long shots or the drone shots, the entire film has been shot on multiple steady cams, which gives an edgy feel not just to the action sequences but even to conversational scenes. Dhar has put a lot of thought into framing of the scenes, and that shows in how the screenplay on paper has been translated to the big screen. There is a scene reminiscent of Iruvar, in which Mohanlal makes an entry into a public meeting while Prakash Raj is speaking on the dias. Here, Akshay Khanna makes that entry when Rakesh Bedi speaks, and this showcases Dhar&#39;s skills in staging an important scene.<br/><br/>Apart from the direction and technique, the other aspect that works strongly for the film is the cast. Ranveer Singh as Hamsa plays his role with a highly intense yet restrained intensity that suits the character. He has a commanding screen presence and, when necessary, emotes in a controlled way to express the pain and agony his character endures when he cannot control certain situations. The other standout performer is Akshay Khanna. He maintains a mean, menacing look throughout. In his entry scene, he appears even more menacing and gives Ranveer a tough fight in terms of presence. The supporting cast of Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, Gaurav Gera, and Rakesh Bedi all perform their roles quite competently. Madhavan appears in only a few scenes, but as the Intelligence chief playing Ajit Doval, he matches his look and persona very well. There is a love-interest thread introduced between Ranveer and Sara Arjun that seems forced, but the screenplay makes intelligent use of it later.<br/><br/>The editing could have been sharper for sure. The transitions were sometimes jagged, such as when moving from Chapter 2 to Chapter 3. Additionally, the director could have cut some of the lengthy sequences that felt a bit indulgent and risked undermining the film&#39;s pacy tone. The action sequences are excessively loud and gory. This isn&#39;t a film for the faint-hearted. The trailer clearly indicated this, so viewers should be prepared for it. However, this level of violence and noise will likely deter those who dislike seeing excessive blood on screen.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s narrative clearly reveals the makers&#39; politics. It appeals to the hypernationalistic section of the audience and doesn&#39;t attempt any monkey-balancing in the narrative. There are scenes that are propagandistic, aimed at winning over supporters of the current regime. The film goes all out to trigger a rage against Pakistan among viewers with a detailed portrayal of the country&#39;s hatred towards India. The putting out of portions of the actual audio transcripts during the 26/11 attacks is testimony to this.<br/><br/>It would have made sense to make this subject into a web series. However, the audacious ambition and scale of the project make it unviable to release solely on OTT. It required a successful theatrical run followed by OTT and satellite releases to sustain the budget. Notwithstanding the length and excessive violence, Durandhar keeps us engaged with the proceedings. If you are a fan of the spy thriller genre, Durandhar is a good watch. The film has certainly piqued interest in the sequel.",0,

For years, mainstream cinema has tried to present a softened, unrealistic image of India-Pakistan relations, sometimes even showing Pakistan&#39;s ISI in a sympathetic or friendly light. This film does the exact opposite-and that&#39;s where its strength lies.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar presents a hard-hitting and realistic portrayal of ground realities, exposing the truth without unnecessary dramatization or sugarcoating. The storytelling is gripping, the performances feel authentic, and the narrative keeps you engaged from start to finish.<br/><br/>What makes this movie truly impactful is its commitment to realism and its refusal to dilute facts for commercial comfort.

While Animal may have had a few cringe moments or story sagging sub plots, Dhurandhar has none. It is rich on patriotic sentiment, rooted in real events, entertaining and gripping throughout, and full of memorable action that never goes overboard.

Real.,"Finally, Bollywood has found its spine.<br/><br/>After decades of soft-focus RAW-ISI bromance fed to us through glossy YRF-style storytelling, Dhurandhar finally gives us a raw, uncomfortable, and realistic look at espionage. At almost 3.5 hours long, the film never drags - not for a single moment.<br/><br/>A major strength lies in its casting: when the supporting actors are chosen for talent and not because the film industry functions like a rojgar yojna, the result is authenticity. Every character feels lived-in, layered, and believable.<br/><br/>Ranveer delivers one of his finest performances - intense, grounded, and controlled. If only he applied the same restraint to his off-screen persona, his craft would shine even brighter.<br/><br/>From the hauntingly amazing background score to the realistic production design and unpolished action sequences free from flashy VFX, everything pulls you straight into the gritty underbelly of Pakistan.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few lines sprinkled in to flatter the current ruling government - but they are sparse and don&#39;t disrupt the rhythm or credibility of the narrative.<br/><br/>This is the kind of cinema we should be supporting - especially after collectively committing a crime against logic by turning Pushpa 2 and Pathaan into blockbusters.<br/><br/>A word of caution: do not take kids or anyone uncomfortable with raw brutality. The violence here isn&#39;t senseless or stylized - unlike Marco, it exists to serve the story.<br/><br/>In the end, Dhurandhar stands tall as a compelling, intelligent, and unapologetically real film - a striking balance of fact and fiction, executed with rare conviction.",0,

rw11008512,spjek,,"A Brutal, Realistic, Gripping Genre Redefining Spy Action Thriller","In the current era of the faltering, synthetic flavored Spy Universes where style matters more than substance, Dhurandhar injects a much needed dose of grittyness and realism enhanced by a strong story, nuanced characters and powerful performances. The movie is indeed Brutal in parts, full of expletives and not an easy watch but thats what makes it real. Do note that a lot of the gore and action from the teaser and trailer are not in this part of the saga. Aditya Dhar has done a great job creating an authentic spy world which is based on real life characters and incidents and sprinkled it with heavy dose of masala to augment the flavors and experience. He gets it right by focusing on things that matter for good cinema - start with a good relatable story, then add well written characters with strong arcs, cast the right actors, give them the reins to bring their characters to life and then take no short cuts to deliver the vision.<br/><br/>Dhar starts with a premise that we have all seen and experienced over the last few decades and makes it relatable for his target audience by splicing in images and videos of the real life attacks that lead to the inception of the Dhurandhar project. He very smartly breaks the movie into multiple tightly written and executed chapters which is one of the reasons the movie even at a really really long run time of 3 and a half hours is highly engaging and entertaining. Almost every scene, character, dialog is an essential part of the screenplay and important in taking the story forward and making the long run time gripping without losing its target audience. The real star of Dhurandhar is Aditya Dhar for creating and delivering on his vision.<br/><br/>Then comes the characters and the actors who inhabit them on the screen. The movie&#39;s main protagonist -Hamza Ali Mazari AKA Jaskirat Singh Rangi played brilliantly by Ranveer Singh is the Indian Agent infiltrating the underworld of Lyari area in Karachi which Dhar created in a real location in Thailand instead of in a studio or infont of green screens. Ranveer may have invoked the character of Hamza in part from Gully Boy&#39;s Murad and in part from Padmaavat&#39;s Khilji but the final result is an effective character of a troubled, skilled, smart, dangerous patriot on a mission. The force behind the creation of Dhurandhar&#39;s spy is Ajay Sanyal, the director of the Intelligence Bureau, a character that has truly been inhabited and brought to life by an exceptional Madhavan.<br/><br/>If a story&#39;s protagonist is as good as the antagonist then we are heading in for a treat to the other side with a buffet of well writen and enacted group of adversaries with real depth and character. The brightest of them all is Rehman Dakait, a role in which Akshaye Khanna literally becomes the much feared and notorious real life gangster. Akshaye Khanna gives such depth to the character that one can see both the human and the devil that resides within. Akshaye&#39;s Rehman Dakait is one of the highlights of Dhurandhar&#39;s first part and one of the main reasons to go on this 3 and a half hour journey through the streets of Lyari. Arjun Rampal&#39;s Major Iqbal takes evil and brutality to a completely new level and with the limited screen time in this part, he is only warming up. In this part, Rampal has shown the potential to create a villain for the ages, so hoping that with Part 2 he can unleash the real devil.<br/><br/>A special mention to Rakesh Bedi who has done a great job in creating the slimy and evil politician Jameel Jamali in what is not only his longest role in a mainstream movie but one that not only parallels but far exceeds his funny supporting roles of Chashme Buddoor and Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi. Sanjay Dutt as SP Chaudhary Aslam is good but is missing the edge, intensity and cut throatedness that one would expect from a character with the nickname, &quot;The Jinn&quot;. Rest of the cast is good in their respective roles with Danish Pandor as Uzair Baloch and Naveen Kaushik as Donga standing out as Rehman Dakait&#39;s faithful gang members. Sara Arjun is decent in a small role which has been set up appropriately, lesser as a romantic interest and more as an important step in the mission.<br/><br/>The real location, the gritty action sequences, the gut wrenching visceral beatings and torture scenes are further augmented by its eclectic background score. The movie doesnt get distracted much by unnecessary songs. Arijit&#39;s Gehra Hua is a pleasant break from the movie&#39;s ever growing tension. Shararat is a bit of a sub-par song that was not needed in the movie but it is easily forgiven because of the spectacular background songs like Hanumankind&#39;s title track and Ez-Ez along with the multiple old Bollywood classics splattered through the movie.<br/><br/>If you were looking forward to watch the movie after experiencing its hyperviolent and gory teaser and trailer, then you are its target audience and will not be disappointed. Overall the movie is extremely gripping and well made with brilliant performances and very good direction. It is long but not boring. It is brutal and gory but not at the level expected. It is not an easy watch but almost a must watch. Overall it is highly entertaining. I really enjoyed it and cant wait for Part 2 on March 19th when the real action will get unleashed, the true evil of some the characters will come forth, a peak will get provided into the protagonist&#39;s troubled past, a big character reveal may take the tension to the next level and real chaos will descend on the world of Dhurandhar. 8/10.",0,

Unlike many mainstream Bollywood spy thrillers that depend on glamour, exaggerated action, or unnecessary romantic subplots, this movie stays focused on the true nature of intelligence operations. It presents espionage as a world of strategy, risk, and discipline rather than flashy heroics.<br/><br/>What makes this film rare and refreshing is its commitment to realism. The story highlights intelligence gathering, surveillance, covert planning, and the psychological pressure faced by operatives. The characters feel grounded and believable, driven by duty and national interest instead of personal drama. This realism adds depth and credibility, making the narrative more engaging.<br/><br/>Another strong point is the absence of forced romance. The film avoids the typical Bollywood formula where a love story distracts from the core plot. This allows the storyline to remain tight and impactful. It also refrains from romanticizing geopolitics, particularly the portrayal of Pakistan, which is often softened or idealized in many films. Instead, the movie maintains a pragmatic and serious tone, reflecting the harsh realities of international intelligence and national security.<br/><br/>The direction and screenplay are crisp, with sharp dialogues and well-paced scenes that sustain tension throughout. Performances are restrained and effective, enhancing the authenticity of the story. Overall, this film is a rare and commendable Bollywood spy movie that respects the intelligence of its audience and delivers a grounded, mature, and honest depiction of the spy world.",0,

rw11023849,ArjunN-00,,Dhurandhar - My take,"Just walked out of Dhurandhar and honestly... what a ride.<br/><br/>Went in expecting a loud mass entertainer and got a solid adrenaline rush instead. The film keeps a tight grip from the start, with moments that genuinely get your pulse going, even if a few stretches feel familiar.<br/><br/>The lead cast absolutely commit - performances feel intense without going overboard, and the supporting actors pull their weight well. You can tell the director knew exactly what tone they were chasing, and for the most part, the execution lands. Action blocks are punchy, well-shot, and staged with confidence, while the background score does a lot of heavy lifting in elevating key scenes.<br/><br/>That said, the film doesn&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel. A couple of plot beats are predictable, and some emotional moments could&#39;ve breathed a bit more. Still, the overall experience stays engaging, and the pacing rarely drops enough to lose you.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Dhurandhar is a crowd-pleasing, high-energy watch that delivers on intensity and performance. Not perfect, but definitely worth the ticket if you&#39;re in the mood for a proper big-screen rush.",0,

You will hardly find such raw acting performances with such great screenwriting and action scenarios equivalent to a well crafted luxurious once in a lifetime movie.<br/><br/>Akshay Khanna being the craze all around the world after this movie is not some promotional hype.

While many movies have put Pakistan in the spotlight for exporting terrorism to India, they often end on a soft, terror-sympathizing, pseudo-secular note. This film breaks that long-cast spell on Indian viewers and presents the brutal truth about Pakistan&#39;s nature and its intention to &quot;bleed India with a thousand cuts,&quot; without any sugar-coating. There is no artificial icing in the name of fake calls for peace and humanity when the other side continues to hurt us. The film makes it clear that there is no grey area in war, and this reality is portrayed unapologetically. It serves as a wake-up call for all Indians to understand their enemy better - Shatru Bodh. Aditya Dhar has delivered before with Uri, but Dhurandhar is on a different level. It is a masterpiece. Every character does complete justice to their role.

Ranvir Singh&#39;s acting was very measured. Action sequences, they do look a bit over the top, but they make sense in the movie.

rw11015611,sunnymishra-62164,,Best spy thriller movie of India.,"It&#39;s not Cringe like YRF SPY universe where hero(supposedly spy)doing Cringe dance and romance.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar Review:
Directed by Aditya Dhar, Dhurandhar is a brutal, ambitious, and politically charged spy epic that moves Indian espionage cinema into a darker, more realistic, and grounded space compared to many of its recent peers.<br/><br/>Why it&#39;s being called one of the Best Indian Spy Movies
* Grounded Realism &amp; Depth: The film is praised for moving beyond the typical &#39;spy universe&#39; clichés. It emphasizes the intricate machinery of espionage, political power games, and criminal networks with a level of research and authenticity often lauded by critics. It&#39;s less about the hero vacationing in exotic locations and more about covert gamesmanship and the high-stakes reality of intelligence work.<br/><br/>* The World-Building: Dhar&#39;s recreation of the Karachi underworld (shot across various locations) is described as grimy, layered, and lived-in, establishing a strong, immersive atmosphere that sets the tone for a dark, intense thriller.<br/><br/>* Masterclass Performances: The ensemble cast is a major highlight. Akshaye Khanna&#39;s portrayal as the menacing, cold, and calculating presence is frequently called a &quot;masterclass&quot; that steals the show. Ranveer Singh delivers a surprisingly subdued yet scorching performance, trading his usual flamboyance for a simmering intensity that holds the complex film together.<br/><br/>* Technical Excellence: The film&#39;s craft is considered top-notch, featuring muscular set-pieces, powerful background music (BGM), and cinematography that builds a genuinely cinematic and epic feel.<br/><br/>Areas where it receives criticism
* Lengthy Runtime: The film, with a runtime of over three hours, is often described as too long or &quot;stretched,&quot; particularly in the first half. A significant number of viewers felt a tighter edit would have elevated the pacing.<br/><br/>* Saving for Part 2: Some reviews felt the momentum dipped in the second half, suggesting the narrative was too focused on setting up a bigger story for a confirmed sequel, leaving the ending of the current film feeling slightly underwhelming in terms of final closure.<br/><br/>Overall Verdict as a Spy Film:
Dhurandhar is a powerful, well-made, and gripping political spy thriller. It takes a bold, uncompromising approach to the genre, prioritizing realism, complex politics, and strong character work over formulaic action.<br/><br/>While its runtime and intense nature might not suit everyone, for fans of dark, deeply researched espionage dramas that aim for cinematic scale and realism, Dhurandhar is a must-watch and absolutely stands tall as a strong new benchmark in Indian spy cinema.",0,

It wasn&#39;t just a movie; it was a full-blown theatrical storm that swept the audience into its world. After witnessing films like Animal and Kantara Chapter 1, which raised the stakes and redefined what mainstream Indian storytelling can look like, I genuinely didn&#39;t expect another film to hit this hard so soon. But Dhurandhar stepped in with confidence and said, &quot;Watch this.&quot; And it absolutely blew the screen apart.<br/><br/>From the moment the movie began, the atmosphere inside the theatre shifted. The visuals had that rugged, earthy authenticity we associate with strong Indian storytelling, while the background score carried the kind of raw, pounding energy that makes your heartbeat sync with the scene.

Every actor came prepared, delivering intensity, emotion, and presence that you just can&#39;t fake. There&#39;s something magical about watching a movie where the cast and the story feel perfectly aligned, feeding off each other&#39;s energy and building momentum scene after scene. It reminded me of the way traditional blockbuster Indian films used to grip the audience - but with a refreshing, modern execution that today&#39;s generation connects with instantly.<br/><br/>What really stays with you, though, is the film&#39;s unapologetic mass appeal. It embraces the culture, the emotions, the folklore, and the cinematic tradition we grew up adoring - but it upgrades everything in a way that feels forward-thinking and powerful. That combination is rare, and Dhurandhar nails it.<br/><br/>Overall, it&#39;s a film that makes you proud of where Indian cinema is heading.<br/><br/>Massive respect to the makers. Keep it up, Indian cinema! 🙌🔥👌🏻",0,

The film plunges viewers into a world of covert operations, betrayals, and national intrigue. While the ensemble cast delivers commendable performances, it is Akshaye Khanna who emerges as the film&#39;s beating heart.

With its layered storytelling, gripping pace, and emotionally charged performances, the film detonates like a well-planned covert operation.<br/><br/>🎬 The Story
At its core, Dhurandhar is a tale of spies caught in the shadows of Indo-Pak intrigue. Ranveer Singh plays an undercover agent navigating Karachi&#39;s dangerous alleys, while R. Madhavan and Sanjay Dutt add gravitas to the narrative. The screenplay is ambitious, weaving together political conspiracies, personal sacrifices, and the moral dilemmas of espionage.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna - The Showstopper
While the ensemble cast is impressive, it is Akshaye Khanna who steals the spotlight. His portrayal of a seasoned intelligence officer is magnetic-commanding yet nuanced. Critics have noted that Khanna&#39;s performance not only overshadows Ranveer Singh but also marks a career resurgence reminiscent of Bobby Deol&#39;s comeback arc. His dialogue delivery, subtle expressions, and ability to balance authority with vulnerability make him the film&#39;s emotional anchor.<br/><br/>Performances &amp; Direction *****

Dhurandhar is a mind-blowing performance-driven spy thriller where Akshaye Khanna shines with unmatched brilliance.

What makes the film so extraordinary is the director&#39;s masterful ability to make us feel the protagonist&#39;s suffering, not through melodrama, but through an unflinching portrayal of what a spy&#39;s life truly looks like.<br/><br/>The violence and gore in Dhurandar never come across as shock value or cheap thrills. Instead, they serve a purpose-they&#39;re narrative tools that help you understand a painful but essential truth: to fight monsters, sometimes you have to become one. Every wound, every brutal encounter, every drop of blood is a piece of the protagonist&#39;s story a story of survival, transformation, and the cost of walking in the shadows.<br/><br/>The direction deserves massive applause. The action sequences are sharp, grounded, and purposeful. The emotional and romantic moments though brief are beautifully interwoven, adding human depth without slowing the pace.

Among the best actors-Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal-Ranveer fits in perfectly as a character who is minimalist, not overly exposed or dramatised, but a coherent and important pillar of the story.<br/><br/>A silent infiltrator turned snake, he slowly grew, learned, and survived the hostile lands. Both the director and Ranveer did a phenomenal job in building up the character with a timed and seamless slow-burn treatment. By the end of the movie, it reaches a peak of emotional turbulence, depicted effortlessly by the actor.<br/><br/>Needless to say, his overall look was craftily created-like a Middle Eastern god who will reign over the underworld for many years. It is a true representation of a secret agent&#39;s emotional journey: from being alone in a disarrayed province with no family or friends, to finding love and purpose to keep going. It looked absolutely humane and grounded, thanks to Ranveer&#39;s natural take on the role.<br/><br/>All the other actors mentioned above need no praise; they have already earned their dues from fans. And what a comeback from Akshaye Khanna-he deserves a big salute. That is why my review today focuses only on Ranveer.<br/><br/>Other than this, I have nothing more to say. The movie is a masterstroke by director Aditya Dhar. After Uri, what a representation! He absolutely knocked it out of the park. People were a bit sceptical about the long 3.5-hour runtime, but trust me-you will enjoy every minute of it. Post-interval, it truly hits its high.<br/><br/>The gritty realism never loses its tone under the gore and pulp treatment of the movie.

rw11024213,omkarnaik-25906,,Excellent movie 👌,"I walked into Dhurandar with curiosity, but I walked out with admiration. This is one of those films that doesn&#39;t just entertain you for a couple of hours and then fade away-it lingers. From the very first frame, Dhurandar makes it clear that it has something to say, and more importantly, it knows how to say it with confidence, restraint, and power.<br/><br/>What struck me the most was how grounded and sincere the film feels. There&#39;s an honesty in the storytelling that&#39;s rare these days. Nothing feels forced or exaggerated just for effect. Every scene seems to serve a purpose, every moment adds weight, and that kind of tight, thoughtful filmmaking deserves respect. The pacing is excellent-it never rushes, yet it never drags. I found myself completely immersed, the kind of immersion where you forget to check your phone or look at the time.<br/><br/>The performances are truly commendable. You can feel the effort, the preparation, and the emotional investment behind each character. There&#39;s a rawness that makes the characters feel real rather than written. Dialogues land with impact, not because they&#39;re loud or dramatic, but because they&#39;re believable. Some lines stay with you long after the movie ends, and that&#39;s a sign of strong writing paired with even stronger delivery.<br/><br/>Technically, Dhurandar is solid and confident. The visuals are striking without being flashy, and the background score complements the mood perfectly instead of overpowering it. The direction deserves special praise-the filmmaker clearly trusts the story and the audience, allowing moments to breathe instead of spoon-feeding emotions.<br/><br/>What I appreciated most is that Dhurandar respects its viewers. It doesn&#39;t underestimate your intelligence, and it doesn&#39;t rely on shortcuts. It&#39;s the kind of film that reminds you why cinema matters-not just as entertainment, but as an experience.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Dhurandar is a powerful, well-crafted film that deserves to be watched, discussed, and remembered. It&#39;s bold, sincere, and impactful-and I&#39;m genuinely glad I experienced it on the big screen.",0,

It wasn&#39;t just Akshaye Khanna who delivered; every actor brought their best and added real weight to the story.<br/><br/>What impressed me even more was the use of real images, real footage, and actual recordings.

The lighting, color grading, and camera movement work in perfect harmony to elevate even the smallest moments, making the world of the film feel immersive and alive.

The chemistry between the characters is electric, whether it&#39;s tension, friendship, rivalry, or quiet vulnerability.

rw11004091,Abhishek-0810,,"More Than Just Action: Grounded, Gritty, and Absolute Spy Thriller","I went into Dhurandhar with mid expectations. The 4-minute trailer made it look like just another violent action movie, but I was completely surprised. While the movie is grounded, gritty, and impressive, I must state upfront that it isn&#39;t anywhere close to Kashyap&#39;s Black Friday, which remains the absolute benchmark for storytelling and its gutsy willingness to name names. However, Dhurandhar is a spy thriller told in its own unique way, and it does complete justice to the genre.<br/><br/>Director Aditya Dhar has done some serious work here. The writing is amazing, particularly the character arcs. He brilliantly weaves in historic terror attacks on India-the IC 814 hijack as the triggering incident, the 2001 Parliament attack, and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks-along with the key characters into a linear storyline that remains so engaging, you won&#39;t mind its 3.5-hour runtime. The treatment makes it feel frighteningly real. One scene, in particular, blew my mind: the screen goes entirely red, and a real recording plays with a transcript. That scene alone showcases the kind of maniacs we are dealing with.<br/><br/>The world-building is believable; it feels lived-in and authentic. The movie also shines in its minute details and research-for example, the mention of &quot;burger kids,&quot; which was slang used in Pakistan at the time for privileged, over-sensitive youth. Dhar uses this to contrast those oblivious kids with the dark, politically motivated bloodshed, orchestrated for power or personal vendettas.<br/><br/>While the story is satisfying, major plot points are reserved for the sequel. The good news is we don&#39;t have to wait long; the next part arrives in March 2026. Dhurandhar is an amazing spy thriller told in its own unique way. Don&#39;t miss it.",0,

Felt little unnatural.<br/><br/>2. 03:30 hrs runtime although felt engaging but still could have been shorter by few mins as it did feel longer in the first half for the interval.<br/><br/>3.

rw11089165,gautamdawar,,Review,"Dhurandhar is not just a film; it is a massive experience. Following the release of Sandeep Reddy Vanga&#39;s &quot;Animal,&quot; many Indian films tried to copy the formula of violence, but only Dhurandhar successfully captured the soul of that style. In my opinion, this was twice the experience of Animal. These two films have become the defining masterpieces of my generation.<br/><br/>I have already rewatched Dhurandhar three times, which is crazy, but the film gets better with every viewing. It never gets boring; instead, you start to notice the incredible details in the world-building. If you want to watch something heavy and impactful, you should book your ticket. As long as you can handle intense violence without feeling disgusted, this is a must-watch. The film perfectly mixes creative high-points with &quot;mass&quot; moments, making it ideal for both general audiences and cinephiles. There is no unnecessary glamour, just raw reality.

rw11013554,RahulH-594,,Not a movie it's Reality 💯,"If you&#39;re looking for a popcorn-munching blockbuster, Dhurandhar isn&#39;t it-it&#39;s a raw, unflinching gut-punch that drags you into the underbelly of cross-border terror. Directed with a no-holds-barred intensity, this film doesn&#39;t just tell a story; it indicts an entire narrative of deception and destruction. At its core, it&#39;s a stark revelation of how Pakistan&#39;s so-called &quot;deep state&quot; orchestrates chaos not as a nation, but as a festering terror hub, pumping out low-rent operations that cost lives and shatter innocents.<br/><br/>The plot? Think high-stakes espionage meets unfiltered rage: a ragtag team of Indian operatives uncovers the cheap, shoddy handiwork behind a string of attacks-fake passports slapped together in dingy Lahore basements, handlers barking orders from safe houses that reek of desperation, and a web of proxies so transparently brittle it begs the question: How does this house of cards even stand? It&#39;s not glamorous villainy; it&#39;s the gritty, budget-bin reality of a regime that&#39;s more failed startup than superpower, exporting hate on a shoestring while the world turns a blind eye.<br/><br/>What hits hardest is the film&#39;s refusal to sugarcoat. Every frame screams the truth: Pakistan isn&#39;t a country in the conventional sense-it&#39;s a terror factory, churning out foot soldiers and false flags with the efficiency of a knockoff sweatshop. The acting? Solid, especially the leads who channel that quiet fury of real-world guardians against the storm. The cinematography turns the glamour of Karachi backstreets into a nightmare haze, and the soundtrack-pulsing with restrained dhol beats-amps up the tension without ever overplaying its hand.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Every single soul on this planet needs to watch Dhurandhar. Not for thrills, but for the wake-up call. In a world drowning in spin, this movie strips it bare, showing the cheap, cowardly mechanics of evil. Skip it, and you&#39;re complicit in the ignorance. 9/10-flawed, fierce, and utterly essential. Go see it, then talk about it. The truth demands an audience.",0,

rw11018257,annievash,,Must watch in theaters,"After a long time Bollywood came with an absolute timeless cinematic masterpiece. The storyline is a perfect mix of real incidents given a fictional undertone to present class cinema. 3 hour and 32 minutes- the runtime which you will not even feel, trust me on this. The story is so gripping that it lets you sit on the edge and enjoy each and every scene- never a dull moment. The violent scenes need parental guidance which is clear since movie has an adult rating, so make sure of this if you are taking your children with you. This time of narrative presented by Aditya Dhar in mainstream Bollywood that is needed to present the image of a new India which is on the forefront on today&#39;s global stage. It&#39;s high time we appreciate our unknown soldiers who sacrifice themselves in enemy territory only for the sole purpose of serving their motherland. The movie do have fictional touches to make it reach and appeal to masses as a gripping story, but the narrative it sets is truly appreciated. Excellent cast, and commendable acting. This is a cinematic masterpiece and not to be missed. Seeing it on OTT would not give the same feeling, trust me.",0,
rw11018132,RaushanK-7130,,"Acting,story,comic timing","Dhurandhar is an absolutely outstanding film that delivers excellence in every department-acting, story, direction, music, pacing, and overall presentation. From the very first frame, the movie pulls you into its world and keeps you engaged until the final moment. It&#39;s rare to find a film that balances emotion, intelligence, and entertainment so effortlessly, but Dhurandhar manages to do it with remarkable confidence.<br/><br/>The acting is one of the biggest highlights of the movie. Every performer brings an unbelievable level of energy and authenticity to their role. The lead actor&#39;s expressions, timing, and emotional depth feel completely natural, making the character incredibly relatable. The supporting cast is equally strong, each adding layers and richness to the story. Not a single performance feels weak or out of place.<br/><br/>The story of Dhurandhar is both powerful and meaningful. It blends drama, suspense, and perfectly placed humor, creating a narrative that never feels slow or dragged out. The pacing is excellent-scenes flow smoothly, and every moment contributes to the bigger picture. There are no unnecessary subplots or filler scenes; everything is sharp and purposeful.

rw11017588,indranilsadhya,,One of the best movie i watched.,"It&#39;s rare for a film to grab you from the opening frame and refuse to let go, but Dhurandar achieves exactly that. This is not just a movie; it&#39;s a cinematic experience that delivers on every promise and then some. If you&#39;re looking for the raw truth, here it is: The movie is absolute fire from beginning till end.<br/><br/>A Masterclass in Performance
The sheer quality of the acting is what truly elevates Dhurandar into must-watch territory. Every single individual on screen-every actor and actress-has genuinely outdid themselves. The ensemble cast operates with a synchronicity and intensity that is breathtaking.<br/><br/>However, a special, singular mention must be made of Akshaye Khanna&#39;s performance. To attempt a critique or even a simple summary of his work would be an exercise in futility. It is a performance that is, quite frankly, way above my paygrade. He doesn&#39;t just play the character; he embodies a force of nature, delivering a nuanced, powerful, and utterly memorable turn that will undoubtedly be discussed for years to come.<br/><br/>The Adrenaline-Pumping Narrative
The narrative pacing is relentless, in the best possible way. There isn&#39;t a single moment of lag or a scene that feels superfluous. The screenplay is taut, intelligent, and perfectly structured to maintain a constant state of excitement and engagement. From the opening sequence to the final, powerful crescendo, Dhurandar is a high-octane thrill ride that keeps you guessing, cheering, and gripped in its dramatic vise.<br/><br/>Final Verdict
Dhurandar is a triumph of filmmaking. It boasts a flawless execution across the board, from its direction and technical prowess to its magnificent screenplay and, most importantly, its stellar performances. This is the kind of movie that reminds you why you love cinema.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and experience the fire.",0,

rw11034586,titaniumframedbot,,"It's not just a movie, it's a feeling, an emotion...","Very rarely am I compelled to login to my IMDB account and say a few words, but here goes.<br/><br/>After all the reviews I expecting it to be mind blowing, but I just wasn&#39;t ready to be mind blown and to this extent.<br/><br/>Awesome storyline, perfect cast and acting, and the soundtrack just takes you into a trance. 3.5hrs just flew by like nothing.<br/><br/>This is not a slow burn movie, it is rather raw, gritty and direct. It engages you from the first scene. To all Indian folks, it will invoke an emotion that&#39;s hard to describe. I am from Mumbai, so imagine. Dhurandhar is not just a movie, it&#39;s a feeling, an emotion a vibe. This is what a movie should be like, the story is engaging, the correct scenes, the right angles (R Madhavan speaking to camera during hard hitting dialogues), the right emotions, the right sequence (just enough to paint the story). I can go on and on.<br/><br/>The details, research and storytelling of Aditya Dhar is just such perfection. I was thinking is he like a Christopher Nolan of Bollywood, but that would be an injustice to the very brand and person that Aditya Dhar is. Words cannot express what magic he has woven here.<br/><br/>Actors did absolute justice to the roles. Ranvir Singh is just a silent volcano, burning with rage and he displays short outbursts in this part of the movie. His anger and emotion have such rawness, it felt satisfying. I am guessing this volcano erupts in next part. His looks, acting, emotions, wardrobe, body language and just seeing him being helpless surrounded by perpetrators is intense.<br/><br/>Every actor is just spectacular and just showed the world what Bollywood is and can be. Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, R Madhavan, Sara Arjun... just everyone is doing their part so well, I wonder how people can even complain.<br/><br/>And I should speak about Akshay Khanna separately. He has always been excellent and still is consistent, and he&#39;s finally getting the rightful praise that he has always deserved. His walk, his attire, his swag, every movement of his body and face is just such acting excellence and perfection.<br/><br/>And just who is Sashwat Sachdev? This music director, garnished this movie with such a &quot;vibe&quot;. You feel the adrenaline rush at the right moments, the actions, the thrill, the suspense, the club scene followed by the chase. The whole movie soundtracks blend and glide so smoothly with the story... it&#39;s truly magical. I was spellbound and still am. All the classic Bollywood hits so beautifully reimagined, it elevates the whole movie experience. The soundtracks echoing with the mountainous landscape, engulf you into the movie. Gehra Hua song for some scenes glides into Jazz and doesn&#39;t lose its rhythm continuing back soon after. Never in my life I imagined a bagpiper music could be mixed into a Bollywood song (Ez-Ez)<br/><br/>That&#39;s what why it&#39;s a must watch in Theaters and people are so addicted to it. It got me so interested, I truly noticed small things, like the rickshaw leaving and arriving sound to create Lyari&#39;s feel when Hamza is talking to Jamil.<br/><br/>Enough said, go and watch it. It&#39;s an incredible story based on true events of several horrible terror attacks India has encountered (including real footage) and a spy mission to identify, infiltrate and dismantle the very core of the terror network. So sad to see, this movie will be kicked out from several Canadian Theaters when Avatar releases<br/><br/>Please go watch it in movie theaters while you can, small screen experience won&#39;t give you the feel that I explained above.",0,

My brother bought the tickets and we just went. Looking back, I feel lucky that I didn&#39;t miss this movie in theatres.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, the movie binds you. You can tell it&#39;s not about one hero or one big moment - it&#39;s about the story and the people inside it. The film depends on every character. No one feels extra, and no one feels bigger than the story. This is proper character-driven cinema, where the story stays supreme over any actor or image.<br/><br/>Everything feels real and grounded. No nudity, no vulgar scenes, no unnecessary drama. The ten-chapter structure works really well because it lets the story open layer by layer instead of forcing emotions.<br/><br/>The fight scenes look raw and believable. No fake hero fights, no over-the-top action. People get hurt, people struggle - it feels real.<br/><br/>Before watching, I thought it might be something like a KGF-style movie - loud, heavy background score, full hero worship. But this movie goes in a completely different direction. There&#39;s no exaggerated heroism or superhuman stuff. It stays controlled and honest from start to end.<br/><br/>You can clearly see the effort everyone has put into this film. It feels like a proper team project, not a formula movie. From the actors to the technical team, everyone seems invested.<br/><br/>I didn&#39;t expect this level of control and precision from Ranveer Singh, but he proved me wrong. Still, even his performance never overshadows the story - it supports it.<br/><br/>The director deserves huge credit. Everything feels intentional. Nothing feels fake or done just for claps.<br/><br/>And honestly, I never write movie reviews. I didn&#39;t even have an IMDb account before this. This movie made me create one just to write this.<br/><br/>With movies like Chaava and now Dhurander, it really feels like Indian cinema is moving in the right direction - more story-first, more character-driven.<br/><br/>Went in without expectations.<br/><br/>Came out impressed.",0,

rw11085231,bedeadly,,Awesome 👍🏻,"*Dhurandhar* stands tall as a powerful and ambitious cinematic experience that redefines the scale and seriousness of Hindi spy thrillers. Directed with clarity and vision by Aditya Dhar, the film presents a gripping narrative rooted in intelligence operations, national duty, and personal sacrifice. From the very first frame, the film commands attention and maintains a strong emotional and dramatic grip throughout.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers one of the most impressive performances of his career. His portrayal of an undercover intelligence officer is layered, intense, and deeply immersive. Instead of relying on loud expressions, he uses silence, controlled emotions, and body language to convey the internal struggles of his character. This mature and disciplined performance adds immense credibility to the story. Akshaye Khanna is equally remarkable, bringing depth and sharpness to his role, while actors like R. Madhavan and Sanjay Dutt enhance the film with their strong screen presence and experience. The ensemble cast works seamlessly, making every character feel significant and memorable.<br/><br/>Visually, *Dhurandhar* is striking.

The film successfully blends action, intelligence, and emotion, making it engaging on multiple levels. Themes of patriotism, loyalty, and courage are handled with seriousness and respect, giving the film a strong emotional core.<br/><br/>What truly sets *Dhurandhar* apart is its ambition.

Ranveer Singh dominates with a performance that is physically dynamic and emotionally layered, portraying a character constantly torn between strategy, loyalty, and conscience. Sanjay Dutt commands scenes effortlessly, bringing depth and gravitas that elevate every interaction. Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan provide intelligent, restrained performances that add subtle narrative tension, while Arjun Rampal&#39;s presence injects a simmering menace throughout. Sara Arjun delivers heart-wrenching moments, giving emotional grounding to the otherwise high-octane narrative. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction expertly balances pacing, tension, and layered storytelling, ensuring the long runtime never feels indulgent.

While most films rely heavily on the hero&#39;s charisma, here it is the antagonist who steals the entire show. The villain&#39;s aggression, screen presence, and ruthlessly sharp dialogue delivery dominate every frame, overshadowing the hero in a way that feels refreshing and bold. His performance adds an unpredictable tension that keeps you hooked from start to finish.<br/><br/>The hero does a decent job, but the writing clearly favours the villain&#39;s arc, making him the true driving force of the narrative. The confrontations between the two are beautifully crafted-raw, high-energy, and emotionally charged. The film&#39;s pacing is tight, with almost no dull moments, and the background score enhances the thrill in all the right places.<br/><br/>Visually, Dhurandhar carries a gritty tone that matches its storyline. The action sequences are choreographed well, balancing realism with cinematic flair. What truly stays with you after the movie ends is the antagonist&#39;s performance-layered, menacing, and unforgettable.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is an engaging watch, especially for those who enjoy strong villain-led narratives. Highly recommended-you must watch it!",0,
rw11028471,Rubayett,,"What a shivering, grotesque and raw depiction of the Pakistani underworld.","Akshaye Khanna dropping one of the greatest supporting performances I&#39;ve ever seen, the rise and fall of &quot;Rehman Dakait&quot; is worn all over the face of Akshaye, he steals every shot. Ranveer Singh with a beautifully natural display and hats off to Arjun Rampal for his brief yet menacing turn. The politics of the film is contentious but for a cinema standpoint it&#39;s a near perfect set-up for part 2. My only regret is I won&#39;t see more of Akshaye in the sequel. Could&#39;ve done with a bit less romance with &quot;Hamza&quot; and &quot;Yalina&quot;, as aside from the marriage it served no purpose in the story, that might&#39;ve helped trim down the 200+ minute runtime. The world building was incredible, I really felt like I was stuck in the mid 2000s Lyari. Grim and dirty in landscape and actions of the gangsters that run the land. Absolutely no mercy shown, nothing but hatred and contempt for those who stand in their way. Ranveer Singh as a leading man yet a shadowy character serves his purpose well, he is overshadowed intentionally and I love the realistic nature of that because &quot;Hamza&quot; is the spy, he is there to assimilate not stand out, part 2 is where he will take on the cloak of leader and dictate the story. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is commendable and I&#39;m a big fan of his work though most/ all as a director has focussed on India vs Pakistan. My favourite scene was &quot;Rehman&quot; entering his home town vibing and dancing along with &quot;FA9LA&quot; blasting away. So much aura garnered. It&#39;s true there weren&#39;t many surprises, everything&#39;s pretty much laid out and plays out exactly how we expect it to but I don&#39;t mind that because this is a build up to part 2 which I imagine will be a lot more chaotic, following the arc of &quot;Hamza&quot; going from a sly shadow to a monster ruler.",0,

rw11010575,AviralM-0,,Dhurandhar. A 3.5 Hour Goosebump Marathon That India Deserves,"This is the first time in my life that I&#39;m writing a review on IMDb, and Dhurandhar is the reason I finally had to. Not because it&#39;s just another big film, but because I&#39;m seeing too many people casually label it as &quot;propaganda&quot; without even watching it, without even attempting to understand the cinematic art that has gone into every frame.<br/><br/>For me, Dhurandhar is much more than a film. It&#39;s a powerful reminder of my country, of the sacrifices India has made, and of the countless unsung heroes who live and die so that we can carry on with our normal lives. The way this movie weaves together national security, emotion, and history is nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>Let&#39;s talk cinema.<br/><br/>The cinematic beauty, the action, the absolutely mesmerising music, the wonderful production design, the elegant dialogues, the breathtaking screenplay, and a stellar star cast, all of this made every single minute of the 3 hour 30 minute runtime worth it. Not once did I look at my watch. In fact, this is one of those very rare films that I genuinely want to watch again in the theatre.<br/><br/>Some sequences hit like a punch to the gut.<br/><br/>The recreations of 26/11, the Parliament attack, and the Kandahar hijacking truly pump nationalism into your veins. There were moments where I could literally feel a surge of adrenaline and patriotism rushing through my body. It&#39;s raw, it&#39;s intense, and at times uncomfortably real, and that&#39;s exactly why it works.<br/><br/>Every character in Dhurandhar is written in a way that you instantly relate to them. They&#39;re not just &quot;filmy heroes&quot;, they feel like people you might actually know, or at least have heard of. Their dilemmas and sacrifices feel personal.<br/><br/>The bike chase with Ranveer is, for me, one of the standout action pieces in recent Indian cinema. That sequence, combined with that pulsating BGM, genuinely felt like I was watching an Indian answer to Fast &amp; Furious, but with a soul rooted in our soil.<br/><br/>And then there&#39;s the background score. The way the BGM has been used throughout the film is simply captivating. There&#39;s one moment in particular that refuses to leave my mind: when Akshaye Khanna and Ranveer Singh face off in their final encounter, and the BGM slowly builds into the &quot;Asato Ma&quot; track, almost like a spiritual echo of The Matrix. That gave me pure goosebumps in the theatre.<br/><br/>Special shoutout to Akshaye Khanna&#39;s entry music, I&#39;m still dancing to it in my head. It&#39;s stylish, powerful, and unforgettable, just like his presence in the film.<br/><br/>In brief, if you:
have a good taste in music,
are a true cinema lover who respects craft,
and know even a little bit about India&#39;s modern history,
...then you are not walking out of this film easily. The &quot;Dhurandhar hangover&quot; is real.<br/><br/>To the entire team of Dhurandhar: Thank you for giving us this experience.<br/><br/>I&#39;m eagerly waiting for the second part and until then, I&#39;ll happily carry this film in my heart... and that entry BGM of Akshaye Khanna in my playlist and mind.",0,

rw11004152,nikhilkhatri-08895,,⭐ Dhurandar Review: A Spy Thriller That Outsmarts Its Own Genre,"Dhurandar is exactly what the spy genre needed - a sharp, swagger-filled thriller that blends brains, style, and raw tension into one explosive package. This isn&#39;t a film where the hero survives because of luck; he survives because he&#39;s two steps ahead of everyone else. Every move feels calculated, every twist feels earned, and every reveal hits like a well-planned ambush.<br/><br/>From the opening sequence itself, the film announces that it&#39;s not here to play - it&#39;s here to dominate. The action is crisp, tightly choreographed, and refreshingly grounded. No unnecessary flying cars or physics-defying nonsense. Just pure, strategic espionage that keeps you glued to the screen.<br/><br/>What makes Dhurandar truly stand out is its intelligence. The plot is a cunning maze, yet never confusing. It respects the audience enough to build suspense slowly, layer secrets cleverly, and deliver payoffs that feel deeply satisfying. The hero isn&#39;t just strong - he&#39;s dangerously smart, and the movie makes sure you feel it in every scene.<br/><br/>The villain is equally magnetic: subtle, menacing, and brilliantly unpredictable. Their cat-and-mouse game is the heart of the film and easily one of the most gripping rivalries the genre has seen in recent years.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is stunning - moody lighting, polished frames, and locations that feel alive with threat and intrigue. The background score intensifies the tension without overwhelming it.<br/><br/>Dhurandar is slick. It&#39;s sharp. It&#39;s stylish.<br/><br/>A spy movie that doesn&#39;t just entertain - it asserts dominance.<br/><br/>⭐ Rating: 9.4/10<br/><br/>A top-tier espionage thriller that fires on every cylinder and refuses to waste even a second.",0,

rw11011388,shrinivaspande,,Patriotic as always Aditya Dhar,"Dhurandhar stands out as one of the most grounded and emotionally stirring patriotic films in recent years. Director Aditya Dhar, known for his ability to blend intensity with authenticity, delivers a cinematic experience that feels both larger-than-life and deeply rooted in India&#39;s socio-political realities. This film doesn&#39;t rely on exaggerated heroism or over-the-top nationalism; instead, it brings forward a narrative that feels raw, relevant, and honest.<br/><br/>The storytelling is gripping from the first frame. Dhar masterfully weaves together personal sacrifice, national duty, and the complexities of real-world conflicts. The film&#39;s greatest strength lies in its refusal to glorify war or paint characters in black and white. Instead, it showcases the challenges, dilemmas, and emotional turmoil faced by individuals who carry the responsibility of protecting the nation. This nuanced portrayal elevates Dhurandhar from a typical patriotic drama to a genuinely thought-provoking cinematic statement.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is stunning without being flashy. The production design, cinematography, and background score work in harmony to create an atmosphere that is tense yet heartfelt. Performances across the cast are powerful and controlled, adding depth to the film&#39;s realism. Each character feels believable, and their journeys resonate long after the movie ends.<br/><br/>What truly sets the film apart is its reflection of ground realities-be it geopolitical tensions, internal systems, or the emotional fabric of those connected to national service. Dhar&#39;s direction ensures that the film inspires patriotism not through theatrics but through truth.<br/><br/>In a world where patriotic cinema often falls into predictability, Dhurandhar dares to stay honest. Full credit and heartfelt congratulations to Aditya Dhar for creating a film that is not only patriotic but also profoundly human.",0,

rw11013594,TheCinemato,,A twisted tale of terrific characters!,"8.4/10<br/><br/>I just watched &quot;Dhurandhar&#39; which is a star studded espionage thriller! I was most excited for the different characters and the chemistry between them, and I must say they didn&#39;t disappoint!<br/><br/>The plot mainly revolves around the gangs operating in Lyari Town and we see it from the perspective of a newcomer, which is played by Ranveer Singh. The movie mainly covers the vast web of underworld, mafia and the politics involved in it, during it&#39;s runtime. The story does seem to pace off in some parts but it eventually pays off and does not bore you!<br/><br/>The first half is designed to introduce and establish the characters and the second half is a massive payback! Once the characters are established, the second half does not waste time and elevates the tension between them. The cast is really good and everyone played their role well! Except Aslam Choudhary played by Sanjuy Dutt, all other characters are written well! Akshaye Khanna is a class apart, and so is Ranveer Singh!<br/><br/>The music is really good, especially the title track which gets you grooving! The action is brutal and decent, it is illogical at times but does not become the weak link of the movie as it is very limited. The movie is filled with profanity and people might find that sensitive and uncomfortable to watch with their family. Some people might find the pacing of the movie slow and leave it midway, but if you wait till the end, the movie does give a huge payback!<br/><br/>Out of majority of the movies produced in India, &#39;Dhurandhar&#39; stands out and sets a new milestone for others to follow. No stylish entries, no cringey dialogues, just pure espionage crime drama!<br/><br/>So all in all, &#39;Dhurandhar&#39; is a great movie with diverse range of characters and a direct relation to real life events! So people who enjoy crime thrillers and espionage movies must try this one!",0,

rw11013706,kaushaldhangar,,Best movie,"&quot;Dhurandhar&quot; is a gripping drama-action film that stands out mainly because of its strong character development, intense emotional moments, and a storyline that keeps you hooked from start to finish. The movie revolves around a flawed but powerful protagonist-often referred to as the &quot;Dhurandhar&quot;-whose journey is filled with revenge, redemption, and unexpected twists.<br/><br/>The film opens with a tense and dramatic setup, giving the audience a clear idea of the world the character belongs to-one filled with crime, corruption, deeply rooted conflicts, and personal tragedies. What works particularly well is the pacing. The first half is grounded, focusing more on narrative building, character relationships, and emotional backstories. The second half explodes into fast-paced action, high-stakes confrontations, and revelations that elevate the drama even further.<br/><br/>The lead actor delivers one of his career&#39;s most balanced performances. He portrays vulnerability, anger, and determination with equal conviction. The supporting cast adds great depth-whether it&#39;s the loyal friend, the powerful antagonist, or the emotional family angle, each character leaves a lasting impression.<br/><br/>The direction deserves a special mention. Every scene-from quiet emotional moments to loud, intense action sequences-feels polished and purposeful. The cinematography captures both gritty urban landscapes and emotional close-ups beautifully. The background score is another asset, elevating the tension and giving the film a unique flavor.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandhar slightly stumbles is in its length. A few scenes in the second half feel stretched, and some dialogues lean towards melodrama. However, none of these issues are major enough to affect the overall impact of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, &quot;Dhurandhar&quot; is a powerful, engaging, and emotionally charged entertainer. It offers strong performances, a gripping story, and memorable moments that stay with you after the credits roll. A must-watch for fans of intense drama and action-driven storytelve.",0,

rw11021159,webervishal,,Dhurandhar : A Riveting Three and a Half Hour Epic,"Aditya Dhar has long shown a penchant for ambitious filmmaking, but with Dhurandhar he delivers something that feels both grand in scale and meticulously controlled. Clocking in at around three and a half hours, the film could easily have felt bloated or indulgent, but Dhar&#39;s confident direction and a taut screenplay ensure that not a minute drifts without purpose. This is a movie that wears its epic intentions proudly yet remains intimate in its emotional core.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a fraught period in contemporary India, where individual destinies collide with larger political and social forces. Dhar crafts a layered narrative that combines a politically charged central plot with quieter, more personal subplots. This duality is one of the film&#39;s greatest strengths: it gives the film the sweep of a socio-political thriller while anchoring it in human stakes. The pacing-remarkable for such a long runtime-allows characters and their relationships to breathe, developing arcs that pay off richly by the film&#39;s final act.<br/><br/>Performances across the board are uniformly excellent. The lead-commanding, nuanced, and always in control-carries the film&#39;s moral ambiguities with a rare mix of charisma and restraint. Supporting actors deliver standout moments that add texture and depth; comic relief is earned rather than tacked on, and emotional beats land because these characters feel lived-in. The ensemble works together like a finely tuned machine: every glance, every silence, contributes to the film&#39;s atmosphere.<br/><br/>Visually, Dhurandhar is a triumph. The cinematography is both painterly and precise, using long takes and carefully composed frames to build tension and underscore character psychology. Action sequences are choreographed with clarity-each punch, chase, and confrontation serves a narrative purpose rather than merely showcasing spectacle. Production design and costumes ground the film in a believable world, while the sound design amplifies suspense and keeps the viewer invested during quieter passages.<br/><br/>A major achievement here is the screenplay&#39;s refusal to simplify. Dhar and his writers avoid easy answers, embracing moral complexity. Themes of power, loyalty, and ideology are interrogated rather than preached, and the film trusts its audience to follow layered arguments and conflicting motivations. Dialogues are sharp, occasionally theatrical in moments of high stakes, yet often quiet and revealing in one-on-one scenes.<br/><br/>If the film has flaws, they are minor. A subplot or two could have been tightened, and some viewers might find the runtime demanding-there are stretches that require patience and careful attention. But for those willing to commit, the rewards are ample: an emotionally satisfying payoff, striking set pieces, and a closing sequence that lingers long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Dhurandhar is a testament to what ambitious mainstream cinema can achieve. It&#39;s a film made with conviction, technical mastery, and a deep respect for character-driven storytelling. Aditya Dhar proves himself not just as an action director but as a filmmaker capable of handling complex themes and long-form narrative without losing grip. In a cinematic landscape where brevity often reigns, Dhurandhar is a bold, engrossing epic that keeps you riveted for its entire runtime. Highly recommended for viewers who appreciate layered storytelling, strong performances, and cinema that thinks as it thrills.",0,

rw11049072,nipunvats-30976,,Substance Over Stars: Why Dhurandhar is the Exception to the Rule,"While I typically avoid mainstream Bollywood-where budgets often favor star salaries over substance-Dhurandhar stands as a striking exception. Despite its daunting 3.5-hour runtime, the pacing is relentless; every sequence feels essential to the soul of the film. The violence is undeniably visceral and heavy on gore, yet it never feels gratuitous; instead, it is a narrative-driven necessity that underscores the stakes of the story.<br/><br/>What truly distinguishes the film is its political maturity. While it exercises creative freedom to offer subtle critiques of specific Indian political dynamics, it successfully avoids the &quot;propaganda&quot; label by grounding itself in universal truths about power. Rather than fueling cross-border animosity, the script exposes a grim reality: how those in power manufacture external threats to distract the public from internal failures.<br/><br/>Refreshingly empathetic, the film refuses to lean on tired anti-Muslim tropes and even sheds light on the often-ignored plight of the Baloch people. Ultimately, Dhurandhar is a sobering look at the cost of conflict, illustrating how the masses pay the price of blind loyalty while the elite reap the rewards.",0,
rw11007159,kohlir-28317,,"Thrills, Stars, and Big Screen Drama","The narrative&#39;s slow-burn pacing ensures that tension, stakes, and character development all escalate organically.

rw11020217,adityajat-04152,,"A Crowd-Pleaser with Heart, Humor, and Heroics","Dhurandhar plants itself squarely in that satisfying zone where a film knows exactly what it wants to be: energetic, emotional, and larger than life. The story leans into familiar archetypes, but the execution is lively enough that the familiar becomes fun rather than predictable.<br/><br/>The film orbits around Dhurandhar, the kind of protagonist who seems carved out of the same rock as classic folk heroes. He is equal parts stubborn, clever, and tender-hearted. His defining trait is an odd mix of bravado and vulnerability; he charges into trouble like a bull but quietly wrestles with doubts when it comes to the people he loves. The film wisely lets these contradictions breathe, giving the audience someone who feels human rather than mythic.<br/><br/>Opposite him is Gauri, a sharp-tongued, free-thinking character whose presence adds both emotional depth and comedic combustion. Her role isn&#39;t limited to being a romantic foil; she is a catalyst who pushes Dhurandhar to examine his own values. Their chemistry works not because they are perfect for each other but because they genuinely irritate, challenge, and inspire one another.<br/><br/>Then there&#39;s Mama Saheb, the antagonist who steals more scenes than he deserves. He&#39;s crafty instead of cartoonish, and his schemes give the film its momentum. His dynamic with Dhurandhar becomes a playful chess match-a recurring tension between brute improvisation and polished manipulation.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s most popular moments tend to be the ones where its tone snaps into high gear. Audiences keep talking about the chaotic marketplace showdown, where Dhurandhar turns a simple argument into a hilariously escalating spectacle, complete with improvised weapons, brilliant one-liners, and a sense of physical comedy that never tips into slapstick. Another scene that struck a chord is the quiet nighttime conversation between Dhurandhar and Gauri on the village bridge, where the film lets its emotional spine show without melodrama. It&#39;s the kind of moment that softens everything around it.<br/><br/>The soundtrack works like narrative seasoning-each song sharpens the film&#39;s flavor. &quot;Sher Maza Zindabad&quot; became the defacto anthem of Dhurandhar&#39;s swagger, a rhythmic, percussion-heavy piece that urges the audience to thump along. &quot;Manaachi Gani&quot; is the heart&#39;s counterweight to the heroics; it blends folk instrumentation with mellow vocals, turning Gauri&#39;s inner world into something audible. The festival number &quot;Rang Bari Dhurandhar&quot; is pure spectacle: color, choreography, and a jubilant crowd sequence that&#39;s practically engineered for repeat viewing.<br/><br/>In short, Dhurandhar doesn&#39;t reinvent the cinematic wheel, yet it rolls with such gusto that resisting its charm becomes difficult. It&#39;s a film that swings between mischief and sincerity and manages to carry the audience along for the ride. The characters are memorable not because they&#39;re flawless, but because they stumble and roar and blunder with the kind of energy that keeps the story alive well after the credits.<br/><br/>Exploring how modern regional cinema blends classic folk-hero storytelling with contemporary tone offers fertile ground for further discussion.",0,

Everything about the narrative, the treatment, and the emotional core works well, yet one aspect that invites personal reflection is the casting choice for the character of Major Mohit Sharma. While Ranveer Singh is undeniably a powerful performer, there is a lingering thought that Sidharth Malhotra might have been a more fitting choice for this role.<br/><br/>The resemblance between Sidharth Malhotra and Major Mohit Sharma is striking. Beyond physical similarity, there is a quiet intensity in Sidharth&#39;s screen presence that aligns naturally with the disciplined, grounded aura of an Indian Army officer. Major Mohit Sharma was known for his calm courage, sharp focus, and restrained strength qualities that demand subtlety more than flamboyance. This is where Sidharth Malhotra excels.<br/><br/>His performance in Shershaah stands as strong evidence. As Captain Vikram Batra, Sidharth portrayed bravery not through loud heroism, but through emotional control, sincerity, and inner fire. He understood the silence behind the uniform-the weight of duty, the personal cost of service, and the unspoken fear that coexists with courage. That same emotional maturity would have translated beautifully into the character of Major Mohit Sharma in Dhurandhar.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh brings immense energy and transformative dedication to his roles, but his style often leans toward expressive intensity. For a character rooted in realism and tactical intelligence, a more understated approach might have enhanced authenticity. Sidharth&#39;s restrained performance style could have allowed the story to breathe, keeping the focus firmly on the mission, the man, and the meaning of sacrifice.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Dhurandhar remains impactful, but imagining Sidharth Malhotra in the role of Major Mohit Sharma opens an interesting discussion on casting, realism, and emotional alignment-one that highlights how sometimes, quiet strength speaks louder than dramatic flair.",0,
rw11009398,reshmark-62200,,Indian Cinema at Its Finest,"I just watched Dhurandhar, and I&#39;m truly blown away. The film is spectacular in every sense. Bow down to the director. Every single frame felt like something Bollywood hasn&#39;t delivered before. At this point, it doesn&#39;t even feel right to compare Indian cinema to Hollywood; our films are already operating on their own level. But Dhurandhar stands out even within that; its filmmaking is top-tier.<br/><br/>Despite being 3 hours and 30 minutes long, the movie never once felt stretched. The pacing was tight, the editing was crisp, and the colour grading was stunning. Every frame was crafted with intention. Every frame was classy and impactful. The music was beautiful, and the BGM in the second half was especially outstanding.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna.. what a beautiful actor. His style, his presence, his impact... impeccable. Every time he appeared on screen, he elevated the moment. He deserves a bow.<br/><br/>And then there&#39;s Ranveer Singh. The way he commanded the screen, even in silence, was extraordinary. He continues to prove his versatility film after film: Padmaavat, Gully Boy, Rocky Aur Rani Ki Beti, Bajirao Mastani, Ram-Leela, Dil Dhadakne Do, 83, and now Dhurandhar. Truly spectacular. At this point, I&#39;m not sure if he can even be compared to any actor of his generation. He is in his own league. People can say whatever they want, but they cannot take away the fact that Ranveer Singh is a brilliant, versatile, audacious performer. He absolutely nailed this role and cannot wait for part 2.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast- R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, Sanjay Dutt, Rakesh Bedi, Sara Arjun and others were all powerful contributors to this cinematic experience. Each of them delivered exactly what the film needed. What a casting.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a masterclass in filmmaking, performance, and storytelling..<br/><br/>Take a bow, team.",0,

Rooted in the spirit of the soil and driven by an unflinching sense of duty, the movie channels a powerful nationalist fervor that resonates long after the screen fades to black. It speaks in the language of sacrifice, resolve, and unwavering belief in the idea of the nation.<br/><br/>At its core, DHURANDHAR celebrates the strength of character that defines true patriotism. The narrative moves with intensity, portraying individuals who rise above personal comfort to answer a larger call-one that demands courage, discipline, and moral clarity. Without resorting to hollow slogans, the film builds its nationalism through actions, choices, and consequences. This grounded approach makes the emotion feel earned and deeply authentic.<br/><br/>Visually, the film reinforces its message with strong compositions and an earthy palette that anchors the story in lived reality. The background score complements the mood, elevating moments of tension and pride without overpowering the narrative. Dialogues are sharp and purposeful, carrying the weight of conviction rather than theatrics.<br/><br/>What makes DHURANDHAR stand out is its refusal to romanticize nationalism superficially.

Ranveer Singh&#39;s portrayal is nuanced, embodying both vulnerability and tactical brilliance. Sanjay Dutt brings authority and intimidation to every scene, while Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan elevate supporting sequences with subtle performances. Arjun Rampal&#39;s quiet menace permeates multiple pivotal moments, and Sara Arjun&#39;s emotional authenticity provides a humanizing counterpoint. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction balances layered storytelling with adrenaline-driven sequences. Cinematography captures the scale of the underworld alongside intimate character moments, and the score enhances tension and emotional resonance. By the climax, every narrative thread converges in a finale that is thrilling, shocking, and deeply satisfying.",0,

rw11095598,framebyrahul,,A Monument in Indian Cinema - I'm Still Thinking About It,It has been weeks since I first saw Dhurandhar and the more I reflect on it the more I realize we have just witnessed a massive shift in storytelling. Aditya Dhar has not just made a thriller. He has built a sprawling eight chapter epic that feels more like a prestige series than a standard movie.<br/><br/>The decision to divide the film into eight distinct movements is a stroke of genius. It forces you to sit with the consequences of every scene. One specific chapter set in the streets of Lyari is a masterclass in world building. We were not just watching a mission. We were breathing the air of that world. It is rare to see a director trust his audience enough to let the plot simmer for over three hours but here every minute is earned.<br/><br/>If there is any justice the cinematography should sweep every award this year. It is sculpted in the truest sense. Instead of the usual bright action movie look it uses a dark shadow heavy style that makes the screen feel alive. The way the camera frames Ranveer&#39;s character often in half shadow perfectly mirrors a man losing his identity to his cover. The red screen moment during the intercepts felt genuinely new for a mainstream film.<br/><br/>The music score is the secret weapon here. It does not just underline the action. It drives it. The synth heavy sound in the climax gave me chills. The way the score transitions from traditional textures into cold mechanical sounds mirrors the lead character&#39;s descent from a man of mission to a machine of war.<br/><br/>While some may complain about the long runtime it is necessary. This film respects patience and craft. It shows the waiting and the mental weight of being undercover. Ranveer&#39;s performance is built on what he does not say and Akshaye Khanna is terrifying because of how human and polite he is.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a technical marvel that refuses to simplify itself for the masses. It is gritty long and unapologetically intelligent. This is a film that will be studied for years as the moment Indian cinema finally grew up. Absolute ten out of ten.,0,

rw11012929,SrinathR-83,,This is must watch Theatrical Experience,"Went into Dhurandhar expecting a hard-hitting spy thriller, and on many counts, the film delivers. Director Aditya Dhar builds a violent, morally charged world inspired by real-life events, giving the story solid weight. The performances are the film&#39;s biggest strength-Ranveer Singh brings fierce intensity and carries the narrative whenever the stakes rise, while Akshaye Khanna and R. Madhavan add depth and gravitas to the drama. Visually, the gritty cinematography, realistic action, and strong background score make it a compelling big-screen experience.<br/><br/>That said, the film isn&#39;t without flaws. Its lengthy 3h 32m runtime leads to slower stretches, especially in the middle, which may test the patience of viewers expecting a tighter thriller. While the ambitious eight-chapter structure mostly works, a sharper edit could have elevated the impact. Overall, Dhurandhar is a bold and intense watch that largely hits its mark-imperfect, but worth experiencing for fans of hard-edged spy thrillers.",0,

rw11008762,Mishy101,,"Probably the most realistic Indian spy thriller, simply loved it.","This isn&#39;t merely a movie, it feels like a gut punch of truth, a long overdue cinematic wake up call for India, from the moment the film begins.<br/><br/>Movie starts with the infamous hijacking of IC-814 which was taken to Kandhar Afganistan and follows up with the terror attack on the Indian Parliament, it makes you feel how incompetent we were and what&#39;s the mindset of these terrorists, and then from there on it grabs you by the collar and drags you deep into the world of covert terror networks the kind that operate across the border, lurking in the shadows, pulling strings from Pakistan. The brutality, the cold calculation, the lies it paints a chillingly realistic portrait of how these terrorists operate.<br/><br/>This film doesn&#39;t do the old Bollywood fireworks, it doesn&#39;t lean on exaggerated jingoism. Instead, it opts for gritty realism. The depiction of terror operations feels raw.<br/><br/>What made my jaw drop was the film&#39;s most explosive strand, when it&#39;s revealed that a minister and his son (movie hinted towards P Chidambaram) being linked to schemes that enabled fake currency to flood the country. The way the movie lays out this charge, the quiet transfers, the paper trails, the calculated betrayals. Watching it, I felt a cold morphological shift from disbelief to outraged clarity, the film insists we can&#39;t compartmentalize national security from the corridors of power.<br/><br/>Performances are electrifying, villains are frighteningly human and bureaucratic, amazing background score and themes for different characters, quite cool overall.<br/><br/>I feel if cinema is meant to provoke and make us look at uncomfortable truths, Dhurandhar succeeds spectacularly.<br/><br/>Controversial? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Brave? Undeniably.<br/><br/>Movie being of 3hrs 35mins doesn&#39;t feel long surprisingly. It&#39;s the kind of film that will be argued about for years, a cinematic blow that asks us not just to watch, but to reckon.<br/><br/>Eagerly waiting for the next part.",0,

rw11003857,z3dverse,,A Masterpiece,"Dhurandhar completely blew me away - and I actually did a bit of reading about the film beforehand so I wasn&#39;t just guessing: it&#39;s clearly rooted in real covert operations and inspired by real figures and events, which gives everything a heavier, more grounded feel than your usual glossy actioner, and I loved that about it; the movie doesn&#39;t chase a single over-the-top climax so much as it carefully unfolds - a relentless, realistic sequence of intelligence work, consequences, and human costs - and that slow-burn, documentary-ish weight made the whole thing feel way more authentic and intense to me. The cast is insane: everyone brings it - the leads and the smaller players - no weak links, and their chemistry and conviction kept me locked in even during the quieter stretches. Direction and production design make the world feel lived-in and dangerous, not stylised for show, and the score and camerawork ramp up tension without ever feeling manipulative. I came out of the theatre buzzing not because of a single jaw-dropping finale but because the film left me thinking about the moral grey areas it digs into and the real people it nods to; that&#39;s rarer than you&#39;d expect in a big film. If you&#39;re after authentic spycraft framed like a human story more than a superhero spectacle, this is your movie - powerful, thoughtful, and properly acted.

rw11096463,Mr-Gahlot,,Dhurandhar: Undercover Fury in the Heart of Karachi's Chaos,"What a rollercoaster! Aditya Dhar has outdone himself with Dhurandhar, crafting a spy thriller that&#39;s equal parts gritty gangster saga and high-octane espionage drama. Ranveer Singh as Hamza is a revelation-fierce, vulnerable, and utterly magnetic as the undercover Indian agent infiltrating Karachi&#39;s shadowy Lyari gang. His transformation from a mysterious drifter to a force tearing apart the ISI-underworld nexus feels raw and real, blending intense action sequences with those quiet moments of moral ambiguity that hit you hard.<br/><br/>The ensemble steals the show too: Akshaye Khanna oozes menacing charisma as Rehman Dakait, Sanjay Dutt brings that timeless gravitas in his limited but pivotal role, and R. Madhavan&#39;s Ajay Sanyal adds layers of strategic depth. Arjun Rampal and Sara Arjun round out the cast with solid support, keeping the emotional stakes sky-high. At 3+ hours, you&#39;d think it&#39;d drag, but the pacing is razor-sharp-every twist in the political intrigue and brutal fight scenes (those goosebump-inducing chases through Karachi&#39;s underbelly!) keeps you glued. The BGM, with clever nods to classic Bollywood tracks, amps up the immersion without overdoing it.<br/><br/>Sure, a few subplots feel a tad overstuffed, and the gore might turn off the faint-hearted, but this is bold, unapologetic cinema that resonates with real-world edge. A must-watch for thriller fans-leaves you craving that sequel tease at the end. Kudos to the tech team; the cinematography captures the chaos perfectly. One of 2025&#39;s best!",0,
rw11044100,svetank-chaudhary,,A Raging Storm,"I walked out of the theater carrying the kind of quiet that follows a storm-the hush that comes after a film has shaken something loose inside you. Dhurandhar is that rare, unflinching work: a brave story told with the steadiness of someone who has seen the truth up close and refuses to look away. What makes it so gripping is its realism-not just in tone, but in texture. You feel the grit of the streets, the weight of decisions, the tension of rooms where history is being nudged, ever so forcefully, into focus. The story, inspired by real events, does not merely borrow from reality; it honors it. The integration of real footage is seamless and purposeful, never a gimmick or a shortcut. It acts like a spine running through the narrative, giving the film a raw nerve and undeniable authenticity. And yet, for all its documentary-like sincerity, the movie doesn&#39;t forget to breathe. It entertains-smartly, fiercely-drawing you in with craft and pacing, then challenging you with consequence. The acting is, simply, fabulous. Performances here aren&#39;t just &quot;strong&quot;-they are lived-in. You see it in the eyes before a word is spoken, in the small hesitations, in the way a hand grips a table edge when the weight of a choice becomes too heavy to carry. The lead turns in a performance that feels both heroic and human, while the supporting cast adds a chorus of voices that make the world of the film feel startlingly alive. Some critics, especially those viewing the film through a rigid ideological lens, seem to miss its core. This isn&#39;t a polemic; it&#39;s a portrait-of moral courage, of the costs paid by those who insist that truth be seen in the clear light of day. The film does not demand you agree with every choice its characters make; it asks only that you witness. And in witnessing, you feel. By the time the credits roll, Dhurandhar has done something rare: it leaves you stirred, not by spectacle alone, but by conviction. It&#39;s the kind of film that reminds you why stories matter-why we revisit painful histories, why we celebrate defiance, why we keep pushing for clarity in a world that so often rewards the fog. Watch it. Sit with it. Let it argue with you. And then, maybe, let it change you a little.",0,

rw11010364,abhinaypande-19587,,Go For It !!!,"I would like to Start with the Real Life elements used in the Film , Like 1999 Kandahar Hijack , 2001 Parliament Attack and 2008 Mumbai Attacks.<br/><br/>Along with The Real life Currency Scam which was done by then Finance Minister who&#39;s name is as we all know sounds like P Bambambram !<br/><br/>It truly shows the Incapability and non serious nature of Govts which were ruling back then.<br/><br/>The Story&#39; Hits you hard as your Blood boils thinking how incapable and corrupt politicians has ruled over this Nation without any true sense of Nationalism and Patriotism.<br/><br/>Now as per Movie&#39;s Story. It sets in Pakistan&#39;s Lyari Town area in Karachi which is even now famous for it&#39;s Lawlessness and Gangland wars
The Characters used in the film , Rahman Dakait , Arshad Pappu , Babu Dakait , Uzair Baloch , Jameel Sahab ( Based on Nabil Habol) , Asif Ali Zardaris close connection with these Gangsters , SSP Chaudhary Aslam , these are all Legendary status guys in Karachi&#39;s Gang history. Their Crimes n Corruption is talked about even to this date.<br/><br/>My suggestion is do watch some documentary or Videos on Lyari Gangwar before watching this movie. Then you will truly appreciate and enjoy the story even more.<br/><br/>Character of Ranveer is fictional and he is amalgamation of all Unknown Gunmens we all hear and are proud of who are living and bumping off India&#39;s enemies within Pakistan on daily basis.<br/><br/>The Story involving Ranveers Character is totally fictional and cleverly set up and mixed with the real life people and their lives. It&#39;s a very Smart mix of Reality and Fiction and Aditya Dhar has done it outstandingly.<br/><br/>The movie is 3 hour&#39;s 30 minutes but am not complaining, it&#39;s very well paced and each n every character is given enough time , so as audience we understand their Nature , motivation. Nothing feels rushed or underperforming.<br/><br/>A big and Special Shout out to Akshay Khanna Sahab, what an Acting. It seems he didn&#39;t act but was possessed by Soul of Rahman Dakait in entire film. When you watch him you will feel that this is how Rahman Dakait must have walked , talked , smiled, behaved , that&#39;s how Good Akshay Khanna is.<br/><br/>R madhavan is unrecognisable. He has done impeccable job as Ajit Doval ( name changed in movie)
And Arjun Rampal, bhaisahab he is so Raw , intense that watching him in every scene gives you Literal Chills. He is surely gonna be the Big Bad Villain in 2nd Part. Yes there is a Second Part too.<br/><br/>And let me tell you the Last Scene , and the Voice of Sonu Nigam hits you different.<br/><br/>The film is dedicated to all the Unknown Gunmens who have sacrificed their entire life, without any form of Reward or Recognition so that we people can live safely . Salute to them , watch it for them atleast.<br/><br/>Just imagine we would never ever know even Names of those People.<br/><br/>Also the BGM is awesome, hits perfect cords at perfect Scenes.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt as SP Chaudhary Aslam plays his part well , and he does look exactly like the Real guy he is portraying.<br/><br/>The film is surely giving Burns to lot of Pakistan loving , Aman ki asha kind of Liberals but it&#39;s a Good Thing. They should feel the burn as the real Truth should be Known to all.<br/><br/>Final Verdict - Just go for it. Book your tickets and Watch it.",0,

rw11020239,BinaG-98,,Best movie for India against pakistan,"Dhurandhar is one of the boldest and most ambitious action thrillers Bollywood has delivered in recent years. Directed by Aditya Dhar and starring Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Dutt, Akshaye Khanna, R. Madhavan, Arjun Rampal, and Sara Arjun, the film plunges audiences into a gritty underworld saga inspired by real historical events and covert operations. At its core, the story follows Hamza (Ranveer Singh), a mysterious Indian agent who infiltrates Karachi&#39;s mafia and terror networks to dismantle them from within.<br/><br/>From the outset, Dhurandhar grabs attention with its intense world-building and meticulous attention to detail. The cinematography and background score elevate the film&#39;s atmosphere - weaving classic sounds with modern pulse - creating an immersive landscape that feels both cinematic and raw. The narrative unfolds over several chapters, and while the nearly 3.5-hour runtime may test some viewers&#39; patience, many feel it never drags thanks to tight storytelling and dramatic momentum.<br/><br/>Performances are a standout strength. Ranveer Singh delivers a restrained yet powerful central performance, anchoring the film&#39;s emotional and action beats with confidence. Akshaye Khanna, in particular, has been widely praised for his role, bringing depth and charismatic menace to his character. The ensemble cast contributes to a textured experience - every actor adds weight, making the film feel both large in scope and detailed in execution.<br/><br/>That said, Dhurandhar isn&#39;t without its flaws. The extended second half and occasional narrative excesses may feel overindulgent, and some scenes lean on familiar tropes instead of fresh storytelling. But for fans of high-stakes espionage, layered character work, and powerhouse performances, Dhurandhar delivers a visceral, engaging experience that&#39;s worth watching on the big screen.",0,
rw11026567,siddbhatt-237-624447,,A stunning feat,"I don&#39;t usually write reviews for movies but this was such a special movie that I felt the need to express my appreciation. This is a movie of rare brilliance and intensity, and one that holds your attention fully for 3.5 hours. The movie is technically brilliant, the casting is great and the script is taut with realistic dialogue. The performances are uniformly brilliant - no one puts a foot wrong and the background score elevates the viewing experience throughout. One rare thing about this movie is the number of unforgettable sequences it has - scenes that stay with you long after leaving the theatre. Watching this makes me wonder why everyone doesn&#39;t make movies in this manner, instead of making slop like Animal with its awful script and cringeworthy dialogue. Perhaps it comes down to the man who put all of it together - the Director Aditya Dhar. He is clearly in a different league to his peers and as he himself said - he wants to make films, not complete a &#39;project&#39;. Can&#39;t wait for part 2 and everything else Aditya Dhar will do for the rest of his career. And yes, I will be going back to the theatre to watch it at least one more time.",0,
rw11046686,traikhy,,"Espionage thriller, one of the best in india","Dhurandhar is an engaging watch driven by strong performances-particularly from Madhavan and Akshaye Khanna-and an impressive musical backbone.<br/><br/>The film still offers enough substance to make it a worthwhile espionage thriller, one of the best in india.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a strong and committed performance as Hamza, bringing physicality and emotional urgency to the role. His screen presence keeps the narrative engaging, especially during high-stakes action sequences.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan, as Ajay Sanyal-the Chief of the Intelligence Bureau-truly stands out. This is classic Madhavan method acting: restrained, intelligent, and layered.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna is exceptional as Rehman Dakait. His portrayal is chilling, especially in the brutally raw action sequences that are designed to make the audience uncomfortable-and they succeed. Once again, Akshaye completely dissolves into his character, reinforcing why he remains one of the most underrated actors in the Hindi film industry.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal is convincingly menacing as Major Iqbal, while Rakesh Bedi does full justice to his role as a scheming politician, adding subtle menace and realism. Sanjay Dutt, as SP Chaudhary Aslam, feels routine and visually similar to several of his recent performances, offering little novelty.<br/><br/>The music is another major highlight. Composer Shashwat Sachdev smartly integrates classic Pakistani tracks like Hawa Hawa, ghazals such as Chupke Chupke, and qawwalis like Afreen Afreen, alongside Indian retro bangers like Piya Tu Ab To Aaja and Rambha Ho. These choices flow organically with the narrative rather than feeling forced.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s jukebox boasts several standout tracks, including the powerful title song, the reimagined Karvan qawwali, and Ez-Ez, all worth a listen.<br/><br/>The background score effectively amplifies tension and delivers the adrenaline rush needed to elevate the action-heavy moments.",0,

Ranveer Singh looked sharp and muscular as Hamza and portrayed his role of a lowkey spy with utmost perfection. Akshaye Khanna, Rakesh Bedi, Gaurav Gera, Sanjay Dutt, Madhavan, Arjun Rampal and all the supporting cast put on a great performance. Sara Arjun portrays her role with innocence and a young charm, just what the role demanded of her. Shashwat Sachdev might have done his finest work yet. Sonu Nigam, Reble, Arijit Singh, Diljit Dosanjh, Hanumankind, Simran, Jasmine Sandlas, Afsana Khan and all the other playbacks really put a soul in the scenes with the tracks.

From the very first frame, the film pulls you into a dark, tense world of intelligence operations, moral ambiguity, and high-stakes patriotism.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers one of his most controlled and intense performances to date. Gone are the flamboyant quirks - here he is raw, focused, and completely convincing as a man shaped by secrets, loss, and duty. The supporting cast is equally strong, with every actor bringing weight and credibility to their roles, especially in the confrontational and dialogue-heavy scenes.<br/><br/>What truly stands out is the writing and direction. The screenplay respects the audience&#39;s intelligence, avoiding spoon-feeding and trusting viewers to follow the layered narrative. The pacing is deliberate - sometimes slow, but always purposeful - allowing tension to build naturally. Action sequences feel grounded and brutal rather than stylized, which adds to the realism.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is top-notch. Cinematography captures a moody, international spy-film aesthetic, the background score enhances tension without overpowering scenes, and the sound design during action moments is particularly impactful.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar isn&#39;t a typical masala entertainer - it&#39;s serious, intense, and occasionally uncomfortable. But that&#39;s exactly its strength. It asks questions about loyalty, sacrifice, and the cost of living in the shadows.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:

rw11018104,samarthdesai-01565,,Next Level Experience,"If cinema is meant to be an immersive experience, Dhurandhar is the new gold standard. From the very first frame to the rolling credits, this film does not just entertain; it engulfs you. It is a cinematic triumph that proudly wears its identity on its sleeve-unapologetically Indian, fiercely intense, and technically flawless.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is the technical wizardry on display, specifically the synchronization of the background score (BGM) with the visuals. The editors and sound designers deserve a standing ovation. The music doesn&#39;t just accompany the scene; it dictates the heartbeat of the film. Every punch, every chase sequence, and every dramatic pause is mathematically timed to the score, creating a &quot;next-level experience&quot; that feels less like a movie and more like a sensory event. The BGM acts as an adrenaline pump, elevating the tension to a fever pitch.<br/><br/>Narratively, the film manages a difficult balancing act. It is undeniably a hero-focused movie, with the protagonist carrying the weight of the mission and the emotional arc. However, the screenplay is generous and intelligent enough to ensure that it isn&#39;t a one-man show. The film features a heavyweight ensemble cast, and every major actor is given equal importance. There are no wasted characters here; each performance adds a crucial layer to the storytelling, making the stakes feel real and the camaraderie authentic.<br/><br/>But the soul of Dhurandhar lies in its spirit. In an era of globalized content, this film stands tall as a rooted, &quot;Hindustani&quot; movie. It captures the grit, the emotion, and the ethos of India without resorting to empty clichés. It connects with the audience on a visceral level, evoking a sense of pride and belonging that resonates long after the lights come up.<br/><br/>Verdict: Dhurandhar is a masterclass in modern commercial cinema. With stellar performances, a thumping score that syncs perfectly with the action, and a story that beats with an Indian heart, it is a must-watch. It is big, bold, and brilliantly executed.

rw11046095,docvsa,,Dhurandhar too violent but unavoidable,"*Review of Dhurandhar*<br/><br/>Pratham grasse makshita pata means the first bite itself tells you everything.<br/><br/>Let me state this at the very beginning: do not watch this movie if you are soft-hearted.<br/><br/>The level of violence is deeply disturbing and can get on your nerves. Despite being a doctor who has seen extreme brutality during post-mortems, I found certain scenes almost impossible to digest. It is disgusting - though undeniably real.<br/><br/>That said, the film is based on actual events, and because it confronts uncomfortable truths, one cannot simply avoid it as mere escapism. It is therefore not surprising that the film has been banned in six Arab countries and in Pakistan.<br/><br/>The movie exposes The Banker, The General, and The Gangster - the Pakistani Trinity that bled India. (Details are widely available online.)<br/><br/>The viral blockbuster *Dhurandhar brings this chilling reality to the big screen.*
Along with the narrative, several shocking revelations emerge. Perhaps the most disturbing is the alleged involvement of an Indian UPA minister, who reportedly sold Indian currency printing plates to Pakistan - the same individual infamously known for &quot;growing cauliflowers on his balcony.&quot;
This so-called Cauliflower Man, his son, and former RAW Secretary A. S. Dulat are portrayed as being deeply entangled in the racket, allegedly receiving kickbacks.<br/><br/>On the Pakistani side, the Trinity included some of the most notorious figures:
Ilyas Kashmiri and Sajid Mir (masterminds of the 26/11 attacks),
Javed Khanani, the Karachi-based fake currency king,
Gangster Rehman Dakait, and
SP Aslam Chaudhary of Lyari.<br/><br/>These individuals are portrayed with remarkable accuracy in the film.<br/><br/>Set against major terror milestones - the IC-814 Kandahar hijacking (1999), the Indian Parliament attack (2001), and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks (2008) - the film follows Intelligence Bureau Chief Ajay Sanyal (brilliantly portrayed by R. Madhavan), codenamed Dhurandhar and based on Ajit Doval.<br/><br/>The convergence of the Trinity during the 2008 Mumbai attacks represents the film&#39;s most chilling moment - the perfect storm of the Banker, the General, and the Gangster.<br/><br/>A particularly telling dialogue comes when Ajay Sanyal says:
&quot;Kabhi koi sarkar aayegi, jisko desh ki chinta hogi; tab kuch karenge.&quot;
(You know exactly whom this refers to.)<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is a stark reminder that modern warfare no longer requires tanks crossing borders. A nation can be destabilized by eroding trust in its own currency and economy.<br/><br/>The film depicts all this powerfully though I strongly feel that the makers could have avoided excessive, graphic violence, even if it was realistic.<br/><br/>That said, the story, dialogues, casting, direction, and performances are all of the highest caliber. The music of the 1970s and 80s adds a layer of nostalgia, and despite its 214-minute runtime, the film remains so gripping that time almost disappears.<br/><br/>An extension of Uri&#39;s iconic sentiment -
*&quot;Yeh naya India hai; yeh ghar mein ghusega bhi aur maarega bhi&quot;*
has propelled this film into blockbuster territory.<br/><br/>One can only hope that the next parts narrate the truth with the same intensity, but with less direct violence and greater restraint.<br/><br/>By *Dr. Vijay Athalye (2025)*",0,

Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt, Gaurav Gera, Arjun Rampal and Rakesh Bedi all carried the movie with as much (or even more) zeal and energy. This is a perfect example of casting done right. The movie is among the longest in recent times, but split beautifully into chapters, woven together in seamless storytelling, with glimpses of real incidents that connect (and stir emotions) with the audiences, that at no point does it feel like it&#39;s dragging on. The set designing was on point, although more easily identifiable locations like the Rose Garden underpass, could have been substituted with lesser known public infrastructure that would pass for the actual locations in the story.

From the moment it starts, you&#39;re pulled into a gritty, high-stakes world of espionage, betrayal, and patriotism that&#39;s inspired by real events, and it never lets go.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh is phenomenal as the undercover operative Hamza - restrained yet explosive, delivering one of his career-best performances with subtle intensity that builds to an unforgettable climax. But this is truly an ensemble triumph: Akshaye Khanna steals every scene as the menacing Rehman Dakait, oozing charisma and menace, while R. Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt, and Arjun Rampal bring incredible depth and presence to their roles. No one feels like a side character; everyone shines.<br/><br/>Hats off to director-writer Aditya Dhar (@AdityaDharFilms) for crafting a dense, meticulously researched universe with atmospheric world-building that&#39;s unlike anything we&#39;ve seen in recent Indian cinema - special credit to journalist Aditya Raj Kaul (@AdityaRajKaul) as research consultant, whose expertise lends that authentic, reportage-level edge to the geopolitics, Karachi underworld details, and covert operations. What makes it truly powerful is how it portrays the harsh reality of Indian undercover missions - the sacrifices, moral dilemmas, and sheer courage our unsung heroes endure.<br/><br/>The cinematography is stunning, the action sequences are raw and visceral, and the background score thunders through the theater, elevating every twist and turn. It&#39;s politically sharp, emotionally charged, and packed with Shakespearean betrayals that keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is paisa vasool entertainment - a muscular, patriotic saga that&#39;s thrilling, thought-provoking, and brilliantly executed.

rw11025515,mo_reviews_mo_vies,,Dhurandhar Part 1: A Fiction Forged from Brutal and Painful Reality,"Dhurandhar truly is a breath of fresh air in the otherwise formulaic, predictable and endlessly unmemorable list of Bollywood movies that have come out in 2025. This movie has the potential to change Bollywood and its attitude on film making, prioritizing story, characters, cinematography over style (which this movie also has an abundance off).<br/><br/>The genius of the movie lies in its ability to hold the attention of viewers for a full 3.5 hours through meticulous world building of the infamous Lyari Town (based in Karachi) during the late 2000&#39;s. The movie does a great job of showing how the gangs in small Pakistani Towns are linked to global terrorist events.<br/><br/>The movie is a technical masterpiece with great cinematography, tight editing and a unique use of background score and old Bollywood songs. The acting and casting are top notch with outstanding performances from all the supporting cast as well. Starting with the gang members, they have been given opportunities to show their own unique personalities. Sara Arjun has also played a convincing character of a young daughter of an MP who has been stifled from enjoying her life at her age and is a perfect candidate for honey potting for Ranveer Singh&#39;s character. Rakesh Bedi as the MP of Lyari Town is as conniving and sketchy as the leaders of the gangs so much so that he uses his daughter as a pawn in order to maintain his political control over Karachi.<br/><br/>As for the main cast, each actor has truly metamorphized into their respective roles. R Madhavan is unrecognizable as the sharp, morally unshakeable and simmering underneath with anger Indian Intelligence Bureau Chief Ajay Sanyal. Arjun Rampal plays the cunning, vile and evil ISI Major Iqbal (although he has a short stint in this movie, the sequel might have a larger focus on him as the main antagonist). Sanjay Dutt was the perfect pick to play the frank, foul mouthed and strong-willed SP Aslam Chaudhary. His resemblance to the real-life character is uncanny.<br/><br/>However, Akshay Khanna takes the cake when it comes to playing the barbaric, ambitious and family loving gang leader Rehman Baloch (aka Rehman Dakait). His screen presence is magnetic and he takes the centre stage of any scene he is in. Last but by no means the least, Ranveer Singh has a perfectly played the role of an undercover spy who is trying to make his name in the Karachi Gang syndicate to uncover the people responsible for committing the terrorist atrocities on India. His understated performance (quiet contrary to his bombastic and extrovert real life personality) shows the man&#39;s versatility and ability to shape shift into any role given to him. Dhurandhar might very well be the turning point in his career giving him the much-needed impetus to go onto possibly become the future king of Bollywood.<br/><br/>As a cinephile, I can&#39;t be more excited to recommend this movie to everyone. The movie truly has the potential to break the old hero centric mould of Bollywood movies and usher in a new age of story and character centric movies. This however can only be possible if we as the audience show our support by watching this movie in the theatres and make it a financial success.",0,

The film doesn&#39;t rely on loud nationalism or overdone spectacle; instead, it trusts its storytelling, visuals, and characters to do the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar&#39;s approach to character-building deserves special mention. Every character feels intentional, layered, and grounded in reality. You can sense the time spent in shaping their motivations, silences, and moral conflicts. Nothing feels rushed or decorative-each arc serves the larger narrative. Dhar proves once again that he understands how to make patriotism feel earned rather than announced.<br/><br/>The performances across the board are exceptional. There isn&#39;t a single weak link-each actor brings depth and authenticity, making the world of Dhurandhar feel lived-in and believable. The acting doesn&#39;t scream for attention; it pulls you in subtly, which makes the impact even stronger.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is how it redefines the Indian spy universe.

The film respects the audience&#39;s intelligence and rewards patience, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>In essence, Dhurandhar is a masterclass in controlled storytelling-bold in vision, refined in execution, and refreshing in its intent.

rw11004811,vs-83042,,Dhurandhar: I believe it's a truth,"Dhurandhar is an absolute triumph of intense, uncompromising filmmaking that deserves every bit of praise it is receiving. Directed by Aditya Dhar, this isn&#39;t the usual Bollywood spy spectacle; it&#39;s a raw, visceral, and creeping journey into the dangerous heart of international espionage and the global syndicate of terror. The film&#39;s greatness lies in its unflinching commitment to realism and its deliberate, slow-burn tension.<br/><br/>From the moment Ranveer Singh&#39;s character, Hamza, infiltrates the Karachi underworld of Lyari, the movie establishes a palpable sense of danger and moral murkiness. It is a dense, detailed world of gang wars and political machinations, all inspired by and woven around real-life geopolitical conflicts. The plot meticulously details the cold, calculating nature of covert operations, making the audience feel the weight of every difficult decision and the true cost of operating outside the lines.<br/><br/>The movie succeeds brilliantly in showing the truth of this gritty, unforgiving world. It is unapologetic, grounded, and focused on the emotional and physical toll on the operatives. The action is not glorified but presented as brutal, necessary, and realistic, especially the hand-to-hand combat sequences.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers one of his most powerful and restrained performances, carrying the weight of his mission with intense, brooding subtlety-a true beast on screen. However, it is Akshaye Khanna, as the menacing kingpin Rehman Dakait, who truly commands the film with his chilling, controlled presence. The entire ensemble cast is stellar, giving the massive 3.5-hour runtime a gripping, propulsive quality that prevents it from ever feeling slow. Backed by a phenomenal, goosebump-inducing background score, Dhurandhar is a masterclass in storytelling and technical craft.

1. Extremely well paced, you won&#39;t feel the time throughout the movie, only time I felt bored was during ad breaks in PVR.<br/><br/>2. IMAX movies are always pleasing to eyes, do take middle seats and scenes and bass will give you chills.<br/><br/>3. It shows true colors of pakistan, not just a hindu-muslim concept, but gangs/politicians working for money and power.<br/><br/>4. Top notch acting by Ranveer Singh, Akshay Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhvan, Arjun Rampal. Even actress and side actors were brilliant.<br/><br/>5. Amazing screenplay, you will start to belive you are in Pakistan, and many times feel sad for the nation.<br/><br/>6. Build-up and explaination was amazing, from the beginning they made us understand requirment for the plan Dhurandar.<br/><br/>Not so good aspects:
1. Too many dialogues to convey hatered for current government(i.e Congress) and a build-up for the new government(i.e Modi Govt.)
2. Not many wow/claps/hooting moments, theatre was almost silent
3. Too much Gore, somewhat was required to show brutality, but making it a Final Destination death was not needed.<br/><br/>4. Just one dialogue that should have been corrected, terrorist says, &quot;Hindu darpok kom hai&quot;, should have said &quot;Bhartiya darpok log hai&quot;. This may make some communal tensions, other that this scene/dialogue no other, not even single scene shows hindu-muslim divide.",0,

Director Aditya Dhar delivers a staggering film that is, simply put, mind-blowing from start to finish.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is not just a movie; it is a meticulously crafted, emotionally resonant, and relentlessly paced cinematic event. The sheer brilliance of the direction by Aditya Dhar is the film&#39;s backbone. Following his previous work, Dhar once again proves he is a master of the genre, tackling a sensitive patriotic subject with maturity, grit, and a spectacular vision. The scale and execution of this project are truly top-notch.<br/><br/>One of the film&#39;s most remarkable achievements is its narrative grip. At a colossal runtime of 3 and a half hours, it doesn&#39;t feel stretched for a single second. The screenplay is so taut and the pacing so dynamic that you remain glued to your seat, completely immersed in the covert operations and intense geopolitical drama.<br/><br/>The technical and performance aspects are equally flawless:
BGM (Background Music): The score is an absolute character in itself-hard-hitting, visceral, and perfectly timed to amplify the tension and the emotional stakes. It gives you goosebumps during every action beat.<br/><br/>Acting: The ensemble cast is flawless. Every actor, regardless of screen time, delivers a knockout performance, bringing conviction and raw intensity to their respective roles.<br/><br/>Patriotic Tone: This is the kind of patriotic film that is the much-needed hour for Indian cinema. It is grounded, real, and carries its nationalistic message with dignity and impact, avoiding melodrama.<br/><br/>A special, towering mention must go to Aditya Dhar for taking on such an ambitious and amazing project and executing it in a breathtaking way. His vision, dedication, and ability to command such a massive canvas are truly commendable. Dhurandhar sets a new benchmark for the Indian spy thriller genre. A must-watch big-screen experience!",0,

Director Dhar orchestrates a rich narrative, blending suspenseful plotting with moments of quiet reflection that deepen the story. Action sequences are crafted with precision, often escalating tension through inventive choreography rather than sheer spectacle. Each supporting actor delivers memorable performances, with layered motivations that make the underworld feel vivid and dangerous. The cinematography captures a spectrum of moods, from claustrophobic intensity to wide, cinematic tension, while the sound design intensifies every heartbeat of the narrative.

rw11098003,rnraoin-43966,,Record Breaking,"Personally, Dhurandhar broke more records for me than it did at the box office.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve never liked a movie enough to watch it twice in the theater within two weeks - until Dhurandhar. I had never done that before. Usually, with OTT releases just a month or two away, there&#39;s little reason to revisit a film on the big screen. But this one was different. Its characters quietly move into your mind and refuse to leave. Even after leaving the theater, you keep discovering more about them through reels, interviews, and behind-the-scenes stories - which only deepen the connection.<br/><br/>I&#39;ve always dismissed remixes as unoriginal, a lazy excuse to repackage old hits. But Dhurandhar&#39;s music turned that belief on its head. Its tracks sound as fresh and stirring as the originals - sometimes even more so. I&#39;ve been looping the album nonstop, and every listen makes me want to experience the film again on the big screen. The absence of official music videos only adds to the intrigue, making the imagination do the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>What Dhurandhar has really done is redefine my movie-watching experience. I&#39;ve always appreciated nationalistic and patriotic films, but most fail to deliver artistically. Audiences don&#39;t pay for sentiment alone - they pay for quality. Dhurandhar succeeds because it&#39;s an exceptional piece of filmmaking first, and a patriotic story second. Its commercial success proves that excellence resonates across ideologies, unlike Ikkis or other &quot;peace narrative&quot; films that have struggled to find an audience.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most surprising record it broke was personal - I never imagined watching a Ranveer Singh film in theaters, let alone twice. Though undoubtedly talented, I often found his performances excessive. The last Hindi film I watched in a theater was Chup. Since then, nothing - no actor, no story - felt worth the ticket. Films like Su From So or Kantara seemed more deserving of that big-screen experience... until Dhurandhar came along.<br/><br/>Many have compared it to Satya - RGV&#39;s finest work - calling Dhurandhar &quot;the Satya of Lyari.&quot; I couldn&#39;t agree more. Every few years, a film comes along that resets the standard and redefines cinema&#39;s possibilities. Dhurandhar is one of those rare milestones.",0,
rw11008116,GambhireP,,There is still hope from Bollywood,"Watched Dhurandhar yesterday, and it genuinely left an impression on me. The film may not be your typical masala entertainer, but it has its own intensity that slowly pulls you in.<br/><br/>The story builds up with a mix of mystery, emotion, and a slight old-school flavor, which I actually enjoyed. What stood out the most for me was Akshaye Khanna&#39;s performance, he completely owns every frame he&#39;s in. There&#39;s something about his calm yet commanding presence that makes even the simplest dialogue hit harder. He brings depth to his character without going overboard, and that&#39;s what makes him so good. You can sense the maturity and nuance he adds; it&#39;s one of those performances that remind you why he&#39;s still among the most underrated actors in Bollywood.<br/><br/>The supporting cast did fairly well too, though some scenes could&#39;ve had tighter editing. The background score added a nice touch to the tension, especially in the second half. But honestly, it&#39;s Akshaye who carries the film on his shoulders.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is not just another thriller, it&#39;s a performance-driven film with substance. If you&#39;re someone who appreciates strong acting and layered storytelling, it&#39;s definitely worth watching once.",0,

Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan provide sophisticated, layered performances that enrich the ensemble, while Arjun Rampal&#39;s understated menace adds tension that never relents. Sara Arjun&#39;s scenes are emotionally striking, her innocence a counterpoint to the story&#39;s high stakes. Aditya Dhar orchestrates action, suspense, and strategy masterfully, creating sequences that are both visually stunning and narratively essential.

It watches, listens, and slowly allows its world to unfold with a kind of swagger that comes only from total conviction in writing and craft. Within minutes, you realise you aren&#39;t merely watching a film-you&#39;re entering a vibrant ecosystem of personalities, egos, secrets and ambitions.<br/><br/>The narrative breathes. Every scene feels measured, yet alive. Dialogues crackle with wit, the dramatic beats never overreach, and the emotional undercurrents are surprisingly tender. There is a tonal balance here - satire, sentiment, and sharp observation - handled with the sort of maturity Hindi cinema rarely attempts today.<br/><br/>Performances are the engine, and what an engine.<br/><br/>Rakesh Bedi, the &quot;yesterday&#39;s young comedian&quot; who has seen decades of stage and screen, brings a touch of genius. His rhythm is impeccable. He does not try to be funny - he is funny. Even when silent, the eyes comment, the body responds, and the scene wakes up. He steals moments with the ease of a veteran who knows timing is everything.<br/><br/>Akshay Khanna gives a performance that is both brittle and charismatic. There is a wryness in his smile, a melancholy in his gaze, and a razor hidden behind almost every word. He moves through the film like a man who has seen too much and trusted too little, and the audience senses the fragility beneath the surface. His restraint is thrilling.<br/><br/>And then there is Ranbir Singh. Physically, visually, energetically - he looks like he has walked out of a polished Hollywood frame. The grooming, the attitude, the sinewy precision of his movement, the camera loves him. More importantly, he delivers not only glamour but gravitas. His presence lifts the film. There is a quiet command in his performance, the kind that makes every scene feel more expensive, more international, more stylish.<br/><br/>What stays long after the lights come up is the feeling of pleasure - the pleasure of watching actors who know their craft, a director who respects the story, and a film that never underestimates its audience. Dhurandar is witty without being flippant, emotional without being sentimental, and entertaining without ever becoming hollow.<br/><br/>A rare achievement in contemporary cinema.<br/><br/>A film worth applauding.",0,

The cinematography complements the tone beautifully, using light, shadow, and framing to enhance the film&#39;s emotional weight. Action sequences are well-staged and impactful, avoiding unnecessary excess and focusing instead on clarity and consequence. The background score deserves special mention-it elevates key moments without overpowering them, reinforcing tension and drama organically.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is its confidence in storytelling. It respects the audience&#39;s intelligence, allowing silences, expressions, and visual cues to speak as loudly as dialogue.

rw11013108,SanskarK-97,,A Relentless Thriller Revealing the Hidden Threats Behind India's Security Challenges,"Dhurandhar is a gripping and unapologetic political thriller that dives straight into the uncomfortable truths the film wants to highlight. The narrative boldly portrays how, within the movie&#39;s storyline, Pakistan as a country along with its government and sections of the Pakistan Army is shown to actively support terrorism. The film makes this theme central, illustrating how extremist outfits are funded, sheltered, and encouraged to operate against India. Groups inspired by ISIS and other terror organizations are shown receiving systematic backing, creating a chilling picture of state-linked destabilization.<br/><br/>Another striking layer of Dhurandhar is its portrayal of India&#39;s internal political decisions. The film does not hesitate to suggest that during the UPA government era, several crucial national security concerns were overlooked. It showcases how intelligence warnings, terror-related indicators, and sensitive geopolitical signals were, according to the film&#39;s viewpoint, ignored or sidelined, leading to gaps that compromised India&#39;s internal security framework.<br/><br/>Despite dealing with complex political themes, Dhurandhar never loses its cinematic grip. The screenplay is sharp, the pacing intense, and the tension is sustained throughout. The lead performances add weight and credibility, capturing the struggle of intelligence officers fighting not only hostile forces across the border but also bureaucratic hesitation and political missteps at home.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a bold, thought-provoking film that raises difficult questions about governance, terrorism, and the unseen pressures shaping India&#39;s stability. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates powerful, politically charged storytelling that resonates long after the credits roll.",0,

rw11047450,JOY02kDAS,,"December, 2025 turns into Dhurandhar 2025!!","For years, Bollywood espionage was a landscape of secularly balanced sugarcoating and safe narratives. But Aditya Dhar-the captain of URI-has dismantled that blueprint. With &#39;Dhurandhar,&#39; he delivers a masterclass in &#39;unapologetic nationalism&#39; that is as technically brilliant as it is emotionally devastating. By dividing the film into chapters, Dhar gives the audience breathing space in a narrative that moves with the speed of a galloping local, meticulously building the &#39;Why&#39; before diving into the high-octane &#39;How&#39; of the mission. The intermediate chapters plunge the viewer into the chaotic belly of Lyari, where the film transcends traditional action-drama. It is here that we see the mission evolve from a strategy on a map to a desperate fight for survival. Dhar&#39;s mastery lies in his ability to reveal character through conflict-every bullet fired and every silent stare tells us exactly what these men are fighting for.<br/><br/>The soul of the film, however, lies in its most haunting sequence: the moment the screen is bathed in red. In those few minutes, as a conversation pierces the silence, the theater transforms. It isn&#39;t just cinema anymore; it is a visceral encounter with a national scar that shatters the soul to its core. Every countryman of Bharat felt a pain beyond words-a moment of collective grief that serves as the fuel for the fire that follows.<br/><br/>The performances are, without question, the heartbeat of this project:<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers his most disciplined performance yet-cold, calculated, and stripped of all flamboyance.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, the &quot;aura farmer,&quot; commands the screen with a gravitational pull that only a veteran of his caliber could provide.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan, as the &quot;Silent Signal&quot; Sanyal, is the film&#39;s moral and intellectual anchor, proving that sometimes the loudest impact is made in total silence.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal brings an intimidating physicality that injects a much needed sense of menace in his character. While Sanjay Dutt&#39;s intense performance adds a layer of seasoned wisdom. Newcomer Sara Arjun is a cheerful revelation, filling her shoes with a maturity that anchors the emotional stakes.<br/><br/>The technical craft is the final piece of this perfect puzzle. Shashwat Sachdev&#39;s score isn&#39;t just background music; it is the film&#39;s pulse, pounding in sync with the audience&#39;s heartbeat.<br/><br/>The cinematography captures the grit of Lyari and the vastness of the mission&#39;s scope with a visual language that is both poetic and brutal.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar has doubled his efforts, proving that Uri was no fluke. Every frame of Dhurandhar feels organic, masterfully crafted, and earned. It is a project that doesn&#39;t just meet expectations-it Clinches cinematic brilliance and redefines nationalism for a new era.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar hasn&#39;t just arrived; it has conquered. So much so that it has turned December 2025 into DHURANDHAR 2025!!",0,

rw11029201,getkenny,,You too Brutus??,"Every once in a while, a film comes along that reminds you why you fell in love with cinema in the first place. Dhurandar is that film.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, you&#39;re swept into a masterclass in storytelling. Aditya Dhar weaves a sprawling, 3.5-hour epic that somehow does not feel long. The entire theater sat in silence-glued to their seats, breathless. The film&#39;s clever chapter-by-chapter structure is pure genius. Each segment builds like a well-paced novel, and one stunning chapter even draws bold inspiration from Shakespeare&#39;s Julius Caesar.<br/><br/>The music is rocket fuel for this film. It doesn&#39;t just sit in the background; it drives scenes forward, lifts emotions, and pushes the story to its full potential, like powering a high-performance engine.<br/><br/>When it comes to action and visual effects, Dhurandar delivers something rare in Bollywood: raw, brutal &amp; unfiltered. Here, the action feels real, gritty, and visceral-reminding me of the savage intensity of Mad Max. It&#39;s honest and utterly thrilling.<br/><br/>But the true magic lies in the performances. Ranveer Singh transforms completely -a sher amongst lions like Scar from The Lion King.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna delivers a performance for the ages. His character is so deeply felt, so unforgettable, it will echo in film history-much like his Sid in iconic Dil Chahta Hai.<br/><br/>Rakesh Bedi, meanwhile, slips into the skin of a spineless politician with such precision it feels like a tailor-made glove. And then there&#39;s Madhavan and Arjun Rampal: both radiating menace, but standing on opposite ends of the spectrum.<br/><br/>Yes, Dhurandar touches on real-world politics. And why shouldn&#39;t it? Cinema has always been a mirror to society-a place where we confront hard truths, celebrate our struggles, and imagine a better world. To dismiss a film because it dares to address issues threatening our nation&#39;s freedom is to miss the point of art entirely.<br/><br/>Dhurandar isn&#39;t just a movie; it&#39;s a celebration of everything great about cinema. If you love film, see this. It will remind you why you do.<br/><br/>Ps: I am also glad the next part comes sooner than later.",0,

This isn&#39;t a polished, stylish spy fest; it is a raw, bloody, and intense slow-burn that keeps you on edge for nearly nearly 3.5 hours.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a career-defining performance as Hamza, stripping away his usual energy for a simmering, intense portrayal of a spy living on a knife&#39;s edge. But the surprise package is Akshaye Khanna-his portrayal of Rehman Dakait is chilling, understated, and absolutely magnetic.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s &#39;chapter&#39; structure gives it a novel-like depth, and the action sequences are grounded in realism rather than gravity-defying stunts. While the runtime is long, the payoff in the final act (and that cliffhanger!) makes every minute worth it.<br/><br/>Verdict: A brutal, brilliant, and brave piece of cinema.

rw11029619,SapnaK-68,,🇮🇳🎬 Dhurandhar - Review (No Spoilers),"Dhurandhar is not just a film - it feels like an experience that stays with you even after you leave the theatre. The storytelling is strong and smooth, and at no point does it feel forced. The narrative pulls you in quietly and keeps you emotionally connected till the end.<br/><br/>What truly stands out is how real and believable everything feels. Every actor has performed with honesty - no overacting, no unnecessary drama. The emotions, dialogues, and reactions feel natural, making the characters feel like real people rather than reel heroes.<br/><br/>This film carries a deep sense of respect for India and its true fighters - especially the Army and the countless unknown soldiers whose sacrifices often go unnoticed. The emotions are subtle but powerful, and they hit you at the right moments without being loud.<br/><br/>The direction is mature, the background score supports the mood beautifully, and the film gives space to silence where needed - which makes the impact even stronger. It&#39;s the kind of cinema that makes you feel proud, emotional, and reflective at the same time.<br/><br/>Everyone who truly loves India, respects our soldiers, and believes in the sacrifices of our brave men and women should watch this film at least once in theatres.

I know they were a necessary part of the story, but they didn&#39;t quite fit the flow. Other than that, my god, the film was on absolute steroids, especially in the chaotically beautiful second half.<br/><br/>It was full of an amazing cast and sets that made me feel like I was living in dirty 2000s Karachi. The action was some of-if not the-greatest in any Bollywood film. Some scenes were so jaw-dropping that I forgot to breathe while my jaw kept dropping lower and lower.<br/><br/>And finally, the boldness to portray the story in its truest form. Salute to all those unknown gunmen who do such things, living in these harsh conditions for years without seeing their families, where danger lurks around every corner and you could die at any second. Why do they do it? I am sure they aren&#39;t going to have immense wealth or a dream of a happy, nice life afterward. Is it only the love for our nation (which is imperfect in so many ways) that makes them carry out these tasks? Maybe these great men have hope that someday this country will thrive.

rw11022582,samyachatterjee,,Best spy movie I have watched in recent years,"I finally caught Dhurandhar in theaters this weekend, and honestly, I&#39;m still recovering. If you&#39;re on the fence about committing to a 3.5 Hour runtime, just go for it this isn&#39;t your typical polished spy thriller; it&#39;s a gritty, violent, and absolutely relentless beast of a film.<br/><br/>The Vibe:
Director Aditya Dhar (of Uri fame) has completely flipped the script here. Instead of glossy locations, we get dropped straight into the claustrophobic, chaotic alleyways of Lyari, Karachi. The atmosphere is suffocating in the best way possible. You can practically feel the dust and tension. It feels less like a standard Bollywood actioner and more like a raw crime saga think Gangs of Wasseypur meets intense espionage.<br/><br/>The Performances:
Ranveer Singh is, expectedly, a powerhouse. Playing Hamza Ali Mazari (an undercover Indian spy), he sheds his usual flamboyant energy for something much darker and more feral. There are moments where he doesn&#39;t even speak, just conveys sheer panic and resolve with his eyes.<br/><br/>But-and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this-Akshaye Khanna steals the show. As the gangster Rehman Dakait, he is terrifyingly calm and charismatic. Every time he&#39;s on screen, the tension spikes. The dynamic between him and Ranveer is the heartbeat of the movie. Also, seeing Arjun Rampal back as the menacing ISI agent Major Iqbal and R. Madhavan as the intelligence chief brings such a solid weight to the cast.<br/><br/>The Music &amp; Action
The background score by Shashwat Sachdev is pulsating and heavy, perfectly matching the on-screen violence. Speaking of violence-be warned, this is a hard &quot;A&quot; rated film. The action is brutal, messy, and looks painfully real.<br/><br/>The Verdict:
Is it perfect? Maybe not. It&#39;s long, and the political undertones might be heavy for some. But as a piece of cinema, it&#39;s a massive achievement. The cliffhanger ending sets up the sequel perfectly.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Don&#39;t wait for OTT. This is a theatrical experience. Watch it for the scale, the insane performances, and the fact that Bollywood finally made a spy film that feels dangerous.",0,

But when SP Chaudary shoots at Rehman, Rehman and Donga had every type of gun to defend themselves. They had every opportunity to kill Hamza with all the guns they had but instead use a blade.<br/><br/>Instead, the guns should&#39;ve been in the trunk and when SP attacks them, breaking the back windshield from the back seat and taking the guns would&#39;ve been more convincing.",0,
rw11011331,AyushS-8972,,Good,"Dhurandar is a lively, crowd-pleasing entertainer that blends action, comedy, and emotional drama with surprising finesse. At its core, the film is driven by its charismatic lead, whose performance anchors the story even when the plot occasionally leans on familiar tropes. What makes Dhurandar engaging is not just its hero-centric narrative, but the way it uses humor and heartfelt moments to maintain an energetic rhythm from start to finish.<br/><br/>The story follows Dhurandar, a street-smart problem solver with a knack for turning chaotic situations into opportunities. When he becomes entangled in a local political conspiracy, the film shifts gears from light comedy to a more layered drama, revealing the vulnerabilities beneath his swagger. The screenplay balances these tonal shifts well, giving the character a satisfying arc that extends beyond the usual &quot;larger-than-life&quot; persona.<br/><br/>Supporting characters add color and depth, particularly the comic sidekick and the sharp, grounded female lead who often steals scenes with her wit. The villain, though somewhat formulaic, delivers enough menace to keep the stakes high. The dialogue is punchy and clever, offering plenty of memorable lines without feeling forced.<br/><br/>Technically, Dhurandar shines with its vibrant cinematography and energetic action sequences. The music is catchy and well-placed, enhancing both the emotional beats and the high-octane moments. A few pacing issues appear in the second half, where the plot dips into predictable territory, but the film quickly recovers with a strong, satisfying finale.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandar is an enjoyable, well-crafted entertainer that knows exactly what it wants to be. It delivers humor, heart, and heroism in equal measure-making it a worthy watch for fans of commercial cinema.<br/><br/>If you&#39;d like, I can also write a negative review, spoiler-filled analysis, or shorter/longer versions.",0,

The movie also doesn&#39;t hesitate to show Pakistan as a state that openly shelters and supports terrorism, and that bluntness actually gives the story a lot of weight.<br/><br/>What stands out is how real the frustration feels. The pacing is tight, the tension keeps building, and the political commentary hits hard without getting preachy. Whether someone agrees with its viewpoint or not, the movie stays confident in what it wants to say.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar works because it&#39;s bold, gritty, and not afraid to call out the things we usually tiptoe around.

rw11026463,Aditya_Bhattacharyya,,"Dhurandhar: A Brutal, Unflinching Spy Thriller That Raises the Bar","Mind-blowing and absolutely gripping, Dhurandhar is easily one of the most realistic spy films to come out of India. In tone and intent, it reminded me of Munich-but with far more relentless, hard-hitting action. Not for a single second does the film lose momentum; there is no filler, no boredom, only constant tension.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is its courage. It is unapologetic and brutally honest in its worldview, calling a spade a spade. It dares to call out the real enemies of India, clearly showing that the most dangerous threats to the country often come from within India itself, while Pakistan comes next. This clarity is rare in Bollywood, especially in a genre usually diluted with fantasy and politically safe storytelling.<br/><br/>The inner struggle of an Indian spy is portrayed with depth and realism-lonely, morally complex, and emotionally exhausting. The action sequences are raw and savage, and the Parliament attack footage, along with the chilling audio clips between cross-border hostile operatives and their handlers, sends shivers down the spine. These elements give the film a dark, haunting, and unforgettable vibe.<br/><br/>The music deserves special mention-totally energetic and operating at a different level altogether. The fusion of rap with Punjabi and qawwali elements creates powerful vibes and elevates the tension and intensity of the film brilliantly.<br/><br/>The set design is shockingly realistic. The recreation of Lyari Town in Bangkok is so authentic that you never once feel it was shot outside its actual location. It is a masterclass in immersive production design.<br/><br/>Casting and performances are excellent across the board. Ranveer is restrained, precise, and deeply impactful. Akshay delivers the character and performance of a lifetime. Arjun Rampal and Madhavan bring the same level of gravitas and conviction, while Rakesh Bedi leaves a strong impression as well. Every actor feels perfectly placed.<br/><br/>Editing and cinematography are top-notch, maintaining relentless pace while capturing the grit, brutality, and emotional weight of the story with precision.<br/><br/>This film single-handedly dismantles the glossy, shallow spy universes with trash storylines.

That&#39;s why I&#39;m a bit disappointed, a film made in the national interest should have been suitable for kids &amp; young ones.",0,
