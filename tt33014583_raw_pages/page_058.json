The lead delivers a powerhouse performance, effortlessly balancing vulnerability with raw intensity. Action sequences are choreographed with precision, each fight carrying narrative weight rather than mere spectacle. The screenplay intertwines personal stakes with high-octane suspense, making every twist feel earned. The cinematography captures both grandeur and minute detail, while the sound design amplifies tension in ways that are thrilling yet subtle. Supporting characters are layered and memorable, contributing to the narrative&#39;s richness. The political and criminal undercurrents feel authentic, grounding the story in a believable reality. By the climax, the tension is almost unbearable, but the payoff is profoundly satisfying, leaving a lasting impression of cinema that is both intelligent and heart-pounding."

Akshaye Khanna... I don&#39;t have words to describe the work of this man. Good to see Saumya Tandon back on the big screen. Aditya Dhar has done a great job. Thank you for this film. And yes he has shown that those mujras and unnecessary robotics and Pak sympathizing isn&#39;t needed to make a good spy movie. Rakesh Bedi Sir&#39;s presence gave the film that humor and he outperformed himself in every scene. Sara Arjun did a fantastic job as well! Danish Pandor has given justice to his role. Overall, the movie is a must watch. And salute to all those unknown men who are protecting the nation!"

From the very beginning, the movie establishes a strong grip over the audience with its intense tone, sharp storytelling, and confident direction. It does not waste time in unnecessary build-up and quickly draws viewers into its world.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of Dhurandhar lies in its lead performance. The protagonist dominates the screen with a perfect balance of raw aggression and emotional depth. His body language, dialogue delivery, and screen presence elevate the character and make it memorable. This is not just loud heroism; it is grounded, convincing, and impactful. The supporting cast complements the lead well, each character having a clear purpose and contributing meaningfully to the narrative.<br/><br/>The direction deserves special appreciation. The filmmaker maintains a tight grip on the storyline, ensuring that every scene pushes the plot forward. There are no unnecessary distractions, and the pacing remains largely consistent. The film smartly balances action and emotion, preventing it from becoming either too chaotic or overly sentimental.<br/><br/>Action sequences are well-choreographed and realistic, focusing more on intensity than exaggerated stunts. These scenes feel earned and serve the story rather than existing merely for visual spectacle. The background score is another major highlight-it enhances tension, amplifies emotions, and adds weight to key moments, making several scenes truly goosebump-worthy.<br/><br/>Emotionally, Dhurandhar strikes the right notes. The struggles, motivations, and conflicts of the characters feel relatable, which helps the audience connect on a deeper level. The dialogues are sharp and impactful, with several lines leaving a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is well-crafted with strong cinematography that complements the gritty tone of the story.

Story and DirectionThe film, directed by Aditya Dhar, follows Hamza (Ranveer Singh), a young RAW agent thrust into a covert operation in Karachi&#39;s dangerous Lyari town. The story traces the intricate nexus of crime, politics, and terror, with Dhar&#39;s direction ensuring every sequence-whether action-packed or contemplative-feels vital and purposeful. The pacing builds gradually, rewarding patience with a payoff that is both emotionally and narratively satisfying. PerformancesRanveer Singh delivers arguably the best performance of his career, balancing intensity, vulnerability, and moral complexity. Akshaye Khanna stands out with a compelling portrayal, while the supporting cast adds depth and authenticity to the film&#39;s criminal ecosystem. The ensemble&#39;s chemistry and commitment elevate the storytelling, making the world feel lived-in and believable. Cinematography and SoundVikash Nowlakha&#39;s cinematography plunges viewers into the gritty alleys of Lyari, capturing both the chaos and intimacy of the setting. The background score by Shashwat Sachdev is a pulsating heartbeat that maintains tension throughout, enhancing the film&#39;s immersive quality. Every shot is meticulously crafted, setting a new benchmark for the genre. Strengths and WeaknessesDhurandhar excels in its blend of action, suspense, and political intrigue, with adrenaline-pumping set pieces balanced by quieter, character-driven moments. The film&#39;s only minor flaw is its long runtime, which some may find cumbersome, but every minute is justified by ambitious world-building and layered storytelling. The narrative&#39;s climax is a masterclass in suspense, leaving audiences eager for the sequel. Final VerdictDhurandhar is a no-brainer for fans of action thrillers and political dramas. With powerhouse performances, technical brilliance, and a story that resonates long after the credits roll, it stands as one of Bollywood&#39;s strongest releases of 2025."

                  "plaidHtml": "The movie portrays reality but blends it with a fair amount of Bollywood-style masala, which actually works in its favour most of the time. The director has set the tone brilliantly, ensuring that the film maintains a balance between serious moments and commercial entertainment. Although some dialogues come across as slightly cringe-worthy, they are still far better than what we usually get from big franchise films like the YRF Spy Universe. At least here, the lines feel more grounded and contribute to the overall mood of the story rather than trying too hard to sound &quot;cool.&quot;<br/><br/>The music in the film is surprisingly enjoyable. The songs are catchy, well-placed, and enhance the emotional beats without feeling forced. The background score also complements the intensity and keeps the audience engaged. Acting-wise, the cast delivers solid performances across the board. A special mention definitely goes to Akshaye Khanna, Ranveer, and R. Madhavan, who stand out with their impressive and compelling portrayals. Each of them brings depth and nuance to their character, making their scenes some of the most memorable in the entire film.<br/><br/>What makes the movie even more appealing is that the screen time doesn&#39;t feel dragged. Despite its length, the pacing is well-managed, and I found myself genuinely enjoying the experience throughout. There were hardly any moments where I felt the narrative slowed down unnecessarily. Whether it was due to the performances, the music, or the overall energy of the film, it kept me invested from start to finish.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie succeeds in delivering an entertaining and engaging cinematic experience. It may not be perfect, but it offers enough compelling moments, strong performances, and enjoyable music to make it worth watching."

                  "plaidHtml": "Dhurandhar (2025) redefines Indian spy thrillers with its unflinching gaze into the shadows of terror. Directed by Aditya Dhar, the film plunges viewers into Operation Dhurandhar, where Ranveer Singh&#39;s Hamza Ali Mazari-a fierce Intelligence Bureau operative-infiltrates Karachi&#39;s brutal Lyari ganglands. Inspired by real events like the Kandahar hijacking and 26/11 attacks, Hamza poses as a local gangster to dismantle terror networks linked to Pakistan&#39;s underworld and ISI, navigating savage rivalries, betrayals, and a forbidden romance with Elina (Sara Arjun).<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers his career-best performance, feral and layered, blending raw intensity with haunting vulnerability as Hamza grapples with moral dilemmas and personal ghosts. Akshaye Khanna&#39;s chilling Rehman Dakait exudes menace, while R. Madhavan&#39;s steely IB Director Ajay Sanyal and Sanjay Dutt&#39;s commanding presence elevate the ensemble. Arjun Rampal adds quiet intimidation. Dhar masterfully balances a deliberate slow-burn buildup-mapping crime-politics-terror nexuses-with explosive action in the 214-minute runtime, every frame pulsing with tension.<br/><br/>Cinematography captures Karachi&#39;s gritty alleys in mesmerizing detail, paired with a score that amplifies dread and triumph. Though pacing draws minor critique amid political undertones dividing audiences in India and Pakistan, the film&#39;s immersive world-building, strategic depth, and heart-pounding climactic twists make it 2025&#39;s box-office king, priming for Part 2. A gritty masterpiece that grips like a vice-unmissable for thrill-seekers."
