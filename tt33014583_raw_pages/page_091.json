Keep watching old style ISI glorifying and RAW-ISI matrimonial spy thrillers."

                  "plaidHtml": "Went into Dhurandhar expecting a hard-hitting spy thriller, and on many counts, the film delivers. Director Aditya Dhar builds a violent, morally charged world inspired by real-life events, giving the story solid weight. The performances are the film&#39;s biggest strength-Ranveer Singh brings fierce intensity and carries the narrative whenever the stakes rise, while Akshaye Khanna and R. Madhavan add depth and gravitas to the drama. Visually, the gritty cinematography, realistic action, and strong background score make it a compelling big-screen experience.<br/><br/>That said, the film isn&#39;t without flaws. Its lengthy 3h 32m runtime leads to slower stretches, especially in the middle, which may test the patience of viewers expecting a tighter thriller. While the ambitious eight-chapter structure mostly works, a sharper edit could have elevated the impact. Overall, Dhurandhar is a bold and intense watch that largely hits its mark-imperfect, but worth experiencing for fans of hard-edged spy thrillers."

No overacting, no weak performances - every character feels real and powerful in their own way.<br/><br/>Direction is solid and confident, and the movie never feels boring. Dhurandhar is not just a film, it&#39;s a proper cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Definitely a must-watch for anyone who loves good cinema and strong performances."

The brutality, the cold calculation, the lies it paints a chillingly realistic portrait of how these terrorists operate.<br/><br/>This film doesn&#39;t do the old Bollywood fireworks, it doesn&#39;t lean on exaggerated jingoism. Instead, it opts for gritty realism. The depiction of terror operations feels raw.<br/><br/>What made my jaw drop was the film&#39;s most explosive strand, when it&#39;s revealed that a minister and his son (movie hinted towards P Chidambaram) being linked to schemes that enabled fake currency to flood the country. The way the movie lays out this charge, the quiet transfers, the paper trails, the calculated betrayals. Watching it, I felt a cold morphological shift from disbelief to outraged clarity, the film insists we can&#39;t compartmentalize national security from the corridors of power.<br/><br/>Performances are electrifying, villains are frighteningly human and bureaucratic, amazing background score and themes for different characters, quite cool overall.<br/><br/>I feel if cinema is meant to provoke and make us look at uncomfortable truths, Dhurandhar succeeds spectacularly.<br/><br/>Controversial? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Brave? Undeniably.<br/><br/>Movie being of 3hrs 35mins doesn&#39;t feel long surprisingly. It&#39;s the kind of film that will be argued about for years, a cinematic blow that asks us not just to watch, but to reckon.<br/><br/>Eagerly waiting for the next part."

The cast is insane: everyone brings it - the leads and the smaller players - no weak links, and their chemistry and conviction kept me locked in even during the quieter stretches. Direction and production design make the world feel lived-in and dangerous, not stylised for show, and the score and camerawork ramp up tension without ever feeling manipulative. I came out of the theatre buzzing not because of a single jaw-dropping finale but because the film left me thinking about the moral grey areas it digs into and the real people it nods to; that&#39;s rarer than you&#39;d expect in a big film. If you&#39;re after authentic spycraft framed like a human story more than a superhero spectacle, this is your movie - powerful, thoughtful, and properly acted. I genuinely enjoyed every minute and I&#39;m already keen for whatever comes in the next sequel."

But the way Aditya dhar has pulled this so well and has set a benchmark of patriotic movies is just unmatchable."

                  "plaidHtml": "What a rollercoaster! Aditya Dhar has outdone himself with Dhurandhar, crafting a spy thriller that&#39;s equal parts gritty gangster saga and high-octane espionage drama. Ranveer Singh as Hamza is a revelation-fierce, vulnerable, and utterly magnetic as the undercover Indian agent infiltrating Karachi&#39;s shadowy Lyari gang. His transformation from a mysterious drifter to a force tearing apart the ISI-underworld nexus feels raw and real, blending intense action sequences with those quiet moments of moral ambiguity that hit you hard.<br/><br/>The ensemble steals the show too: Akshaye Khanna oozes menacing charisma as Rehman Dakait, Sanjay Dutt brings that timeless gravitas in his limited but pivotal role, and R. Madhavan&#39;s Ajay Sanyal adds layers of strategic depth. Arjun Rampal and Sara Arjun round out the cast with solid support, keeping the emotional stakes sky-high. At 3+ hours, you&#39;d think it&#39;d drag, but the pacing is razor-sharp-every twist in the political intrigue and brutal fight scenes (those goosebump-inducing chases through Karachi&#39;s underbelly!) keeps you glued. The BGM, with clever nods to classic Bollywood tracks, amps up the immersion without overdoing it.<br/><br/>Sure, a few subplots feel a tad overstuffed, and the gore might turn off the faint-hearted, but this is bold, unapologetic cinema that resonates with real-world edge. A must-watch for thriller fans-leaves you craving that sequel tease at the end. Kudos to the tech team; the cinematography captures the chaos perfectly. One of 2025&#39;s best!"

                  "plaidHtml": "I walked out of the theater carrying the kind of quiet that follows a storm-the hush that comes after a film has shaken something loose inside you. Dhurandhar is that rare, unflinching work: a brave story told with the steadiness of someone who has seen the truth up close and refuses to look away. What makes it so gripping is its realism-not just in tone, but in texture. You feel the grit of the streets, the weight of decisions, the tension of rooms where history is being nudged, ever so forcefully, into focus. The story, inspired by real events, does not merely borrow from reality; it honors it. The integration of real footage is seamless and purposeful, never a gimmick or a shortcut. It acts like a spine running through the narrative, giving the film a raw nerve and undeniable authenticity. And yet, for all its documentary-like sincerity, the movie doesn&#39;t forget to breathe. It entertains-smartly, fiercely-drawing you in with craft and pacing, then challenging you with consequence. The acting is, simply, fabulous. Performances here aren&#39;t just &quot;strong&quot;-they are lived-in. You see it in the eyes before a word is spoken, in the small hesitations, in the way a hand grips a table edge when the weight of a choice becomes too heavy to carry. The lead turns in a performance that feels both heroic and human, while the supporting cast adds a chorus of voices that make the world of the film feel startlingly alive. Some critics, especially those viewing the film through a rigid ideological lens, seem to miss its core. This isn&#39;t a polemic; it&#39;s a portrait-of moral courage, of the costs paid by those who insist that truth be seen in the clear light of day. The film does not demand you agree with every choice its characters make; it asks only that you witness. And in witnessing, you feel. By the time the credits roll, Dhurandhar has done something rare: it leaves you stirred, not by spectacle alone, but by conviction. It&#39;s the kind of film that reminds you why stories matter-why we revisit painful histories, why we celebrate defiance, why we keep pushing for clarity in a world that so often rewards the fog. Watch it. Sit with it. Let it argue with you. And then, maybe, let it change you a little."
