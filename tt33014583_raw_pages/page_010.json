A must-watch for lovers of strong drama and high-voltage performances. Best one bollywood produced in a while. This is how Animal should have been."

Aside of these politics, the movie is brilliantly crafted. 100% sure it would have took 1 year of hard work, just to write a story this well. Technically brilliant, almost capable of representing indian movies on international level.<br/><br/>Cons:\nWould be 10 20 mins shorter.<br/><br/>Sanjay Datt entry scene felt technically weak."

With it&#39;s good researched inspiration from true events, it excels in cinematography, music and story. Indian cinema has always been pro-muslim and anti-Hindu or politically correct to plant false narratives, just to appease Pakistani diaspora in middle east countries. But this movie is politically incorrect, raw and hiting hard with reality. Yes, creative liberties have been taken as usual. A big thumbs up to Aditya Dhar and team."

The dialogues and story writing are exceptional, thoughtfully crafted, and enriched with references to both the Mahabharata and Shakespeare.

I highly recommend this movie to everyone, particularly due to its captivating songs and background music."

Every frame feels intentional, every silence speaks, and every emotion lands with remarkable precision. The storytelling is layered yet accessible, powerful without being loud. It respects the intelligence of the audience and rewards patience with depth.<br/><br/>The performances are nothing short of extraordinary. Each actor inhabits their character so completely that the line between performance and reality begins to blur. The direction is confident and mature, allowing the story to unfold organically rather than forcing moments for effect.<br/><br/>Technically, Dhurandhar is impeccable. The cinematography elevates the narrative, the background score enhances emotion without overpowering it, and the editing maintains a gripping rhythm throughout. There is restraint, balance, and an unmistakable sense of craft-something Bollywood has been searching for but rarely achieves.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is its honesty. It doesn&#39;t rely on clichés or formulaic storytelling. Instead, it trusts its narrative and its audience. This is cinema that lingers long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>Films like this remind us of what Bollywood is capable of when vision, passion, and execution align perfectly. Dhurandhar is not just one of the best films in recent years-it&#39;s a benchmark."

                  "plaidHtml": "Watched the Hindi film Dhurandhar for the second time in theatres-nearly a month after its release-and the house was still packed.<br/><br/>This espionage thriller opens with the 1999 Kandahar hijacking, with IB chief Ajay Sanyal (R. Madhavan) at the centre of the crisis-setting the tone for the film&#39;s tense, geopolitical canvas.<br/><br/>From there, the story dives into a high-stakes infiltration of Karachi&#39;s underworld. The first half tracks undercover operative Hamza Ali Mazari (Ranveer Singh) as he enters Lyari, building credibility from the ground up-often through brute violence, rapid-fire action, and nail-biting underworld escalations. Along the way, he&#39;s anchored by Mohammad Aalam (Gaurav Gera), a grounded presence amid the chaos.<br/><br/>The narrative also weaves in depictions of major terror incidents, including the 2001 Parliament attack and the 2008 Mumbai attacks, adding a heavy political and emotional charge to the first half.<br/><br/>The second half moves even faster, stitching together the political ecosystem and its deep links with the underworld. It highlights the power structures that run Karachi from the shadows-where influence, arms pipelines, and backroom alliances matter as much as street muscle. It also touches on the Balochistan angle and the region&#39;s simmering tensions, portraying violence and criminal rivalry as a grim, everyday reality.<br/><br/>Without getting into spoilers, the film ends on a sharp final turn involving Rehman Dakait (Akshaye Khanna) that decisively sets the stage for Part 2.<br/><br/>And yes-I tried hard to keep the &quot;spice&quot; in check while writing this review. Not easy at all!<br/><br/>Performances<br/><br/>The film boasts a terrific ensemble. Ranveer Singh as Hamza Ali Mazari delivers a remarkably controlled performance-measured, intense, and completely convincing.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, as Rehman Dakait, is tailor-made for the role-quiet menace, sharp presence, and perfectly calibrated intimidation.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan as Ajay Sanyal brings gravitas and moral weight to the narrative&#39;s big decisions.<br/><br/>Sara Arjun as Yalina Jamali looks stunning, commands the screen, and feels like a genuinely strong fit for the part.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt as S. P. Choudhary Aslam adds solid heft, and Arjun Rampal as Major Iqbal plays his part with authority.<br/><br/>Technical strengths<br/><br/>Technically, the film is top-class. Shashwat Sachdev&#39;s music is terrific, the background score lands cleanly, and the cinematography (Vikash Nowlakha) and editing (Shivkumar V. Panicker) are of a very high standard. The production design feels grounded and real-every department shows up.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar feels like a near-perfect blend of commercial cinema and a gripping thriller-songs, scale, and patriotism, while weaving in espionage and the complexities of Indo-Pakistan dynamics. I&#39;m genuinely eager for Dhurandhar: Part 2, slated for 19 March 2026."

                  "plaidHtml": "Overview\nThis was a star studded blockbuster in every sense of the word. Huge set pieces, gory violence, terrific performances, strong political messaging, and an exorbitant run time. A lot to unpack here so to make it easier:<br/><br/>The Good:\n<ul><li>Phenomenal performances by the cast, more on that later.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Set design and attention to detail when creating Karachi was excellent. References and the look are very on point and added to the realism.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Storyline is very compelling.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Realistic action sequences. I have been calling out for this as in Hindi cinema action sequences are mostly idiotic and ridiculous with the protagonist usually turning into some sort of avenger. Dhurandhar keeps it as real as possible leading to effective sequences.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Bad:\n<ul><li>No sense of nuance at all. The good Indian characters are always good. The bad Pakistani characters are always bad. There&#39;s no self-reflection on the part of the protagonist or questioning his own morality as he carries out the most shocking acts. Does not add much depth to the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Clunky political commentary. At times it resembles a documentary as Aditya Dhar hits the audience on the head with his views. At one point they even stop the entire movie to show audio of real terrorist interactions. This constantly takes the audience out of the film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Violence and gore. Was really good to a point, but again there is no restraint shown from the director, every scene had be extremely gory and in my opinion, they overdid it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ranveer Singh is the lead, but he basically has nothing to do. A couple of smart edits and this movie ends up being a good film on Pakistani gang wars. It&#39;s almost like there are two separate films going on and there was an awkward attempt to stitch them together.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, a good watch and I enjoyed the film, but it is not the greatest movie of all time that some commentary seems to be pushing, nor is it the worst movie as others imply. It is an entertaining watch but with a fair number of loopholes.<br/><br/>Plot\nThe film follows the protagonist, Hamza Ali Mazari (Ranveer Singh), an agent sent from India to infiltrate the Pakistani underworld based in the city of Karachi with the aim of passing information to India to stop terror related activities.<br/><br/>Acting\n<ul><li>Ranveer Singh: What I thought was going to be a Ranveer Singh blockbuster ended up being a blockbuster without much of Ranveer Singh. He&#39;s a good actor and he did well in the role but was totally overshadowed by his co-stars. His own side quests were probably the least interesting parts of the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Akshaye Khanna: Nothing more to say but absolutely brilliant. Easily stole the show as the vicious gangster Rehman Dakait.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sanjay Dutt: A good performance by Sanju brought a grittiness to his police role.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sara Arjun: A bit of a meh showing. To be fair she did not have a whole lot to do, and her character was largely badly written.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Arjun Rampal: The epitome of evil in this movie and Arjun Rampal rose to the challenge extremely effectively. The next best performance after Akshaye Khanna.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Rakesh Bedi: This was the performance that didn&#39;t make sense. This powerful politician being portrayed in a weak and goofy way did not really mesh with the rest of the characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>R Madhavan: A strong showing but was let down by weak writing. Half of his dialogues were not meant to be movie lines but rather overt political messaging. As such at various times he just sounded like a propaganda poster rather than a real person.</li></ul><br/><br/>Music\nThe music is fantastic really adding to what is going on on screen. Has also added to the virality of the film on social media.<br/><br/>Conclusion\nIf you can handle the violence and gore, I do recommend this as a good watch. With a sequel slated to be released in a matter of months, this movie did its job in building anticipation for the sequel.<br/><br/>7/10."

Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is confident and bold, creating a world that feels authentic, tense, and relevant.<br/><br/>Yes, the runtime is long, but the scale, storytelling, and performances keep you invested. The action sequences are well-choreographed, the background score elevates key moments, and the film sparks thought and discussion long after it ends.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is not just entertainment, it&#39;s an experience. A powerful, ambitious film that stands out in Indian cinema.<br/><br/>Must watch. 10/10."

                  "plaidHtml": "If you are looking for performances that sear the screen, Dhurandhar is unmissable. The casting is nothing short of a coup, pitting two of the industry&#39;s most intense performers against one another in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse. The film thrives when it focuses on the psychological warfare between its leads, who elevate the material far beyond standard genre conventions.<br/><br/>Singh and Khanna: A Volatile Chemistry\nThe film&#39;s greatest asset is undoubtedly its cast. Ranveer Singh delivers a &quot;feral&quot; and &quot;electrifying&quot; performance as Hamza, stripping away his usual flamboyance to embody a covert operative with simmering intensity. Opposite him, Akshaye Khanna is terrifyingly calm as the antagonist, Rehman Dakait. Khanna steals every scene he is in, proving once again that he is a master of understated menace. When Singh and Khanna share the screen, the tension is palpable; their verbal spars are far more gripping than any explosion the director could conjure.<br/><br/>Indulgent Action Sequences\nHowever, the movie falters significantly in its pacing, particularly during the physical confrontations. While the face-off between Singh and Khanna was highly anticipated, the actual fight sequences feel &quot;made&quot; long-extended well beyond necessity. The runtime drags as the director indulges in exhaustive brawls that seem designed to showcase the stars&#39; stamina rather than advance the plot. These moments of excess dilute the tight, character-driven drama that makes the first half so compelling.<br/><br/>Verdict\nDhurandhar is a must-watch for the acting duel between Singh and Khanna, who are in top form. But be prepared to check your watch during the climactic battles, which overstay their welcome in an otherwise gripping thriller."

                  "plaidHtml": "Best movie of the year 2025. Dhurandhar is a gripping film that lives up to its title, presenting a story full of intensity, strategy, and emotional conflict. The movie stands out for its strong narrative drive and layered characters, keeping the audience engaged from the opening scenes to the final act.<br/><br/>The storyline revolves around ambition, power, and the cost of cleverness. Rather than relying only on action or spectacle, Dhurandhar focuses on mind games, moral dilemmas, and shifting loyalties. This makes the film intellectually engaging as well as emotionally impactful. The screenplay is tightly written, with several moments that surprise the viewer without feeling forced.<br/><br/>Performances are one of the film&#39;s biggest strengths. The lead actor&#39;s like ranveer , akshay khanna as rehman dakait deliver a convincing portrayal of a complex character, balancing intelligence, arrogance, and vulnerability with ease. Supporting actors also do a commendable job, adding depth to the narrative and ensuring that even secondary roles feel meaningful. The dialogues are sharp and memorable, often carrying more weight than loud dramatic moments.<br/><br/>From a technical perspective, the direction is confident and controlled. The pacing is mostly steady, though a few scenes in the middle could have been trimmed for better flow. Cinematography effectively captures the mood of the film, using lighting and framing to reflect tension and inner conflict. The background score complements the story well, enhancing dramatic moments without overpowering them.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is a well-crafted film that appeals to viewers who enjoy intense drama with a strong psychological element. It may not cater to those looking for light entertainment, but for audiences who appreciate smart storytelling and powerful performances, Dhurandhar is definitely worth watching."

Akshaye Khanna stands at top of the acting Pyramid with Irfan Khan, Manoj Vajpayee and others.<br/><br/>Rakesh Bedi is underrated and delivered such an incredible performace - I watched the movie thrice in 3 different cities - everytime the audience bas the same reaction whe he came on the screen.<br/><br/>I can go on an on about the story, music, performances and everything.

This film excels in every department. Despite its nearly three-and-a-half-hour runtime, it never drags or feels indulgent; instead, it keeps you constantly engaged, sitting on the edge of your seat. The sheer level of layering in the storytelling is unlike anything seen in Indian cinema before. The editing is bold, inventive, and razor-sharp, perfectly complementing the film&#39;s highly stylized action. Yet, despite its stylization, everything feels grounded and real...never overly polished or artificial. This is filmmaking at its highest level, a benchmark for what Indian cinema can achieve."
