It isn&#39;t merely entertainment; it&#39;s an experience that lingers in the memory, inviting both awe and reflection.<br/><br/>Plot and Pacing\nDhurandhar crafts a taut, sweeping narrative that balances grand, high-stakes twists with intimate, character-driven moments. The pacing is meticulous: every scene earns its keep, everyline of dialogue lands with precision, and the tension builds with an almost mathematical inevitability. The central mystery hooks you in seconds and never lets go, yet the film never loses sight of the emotional throughline that gives it real soul.<br/><br/>Performances\nLead Performance: A tour de force. Ranveer Singh navigates a roller-coaster of grit, vulnerability, and quiet resolve with a magnetic clarity. Subtle choices-a look here, a tremor there-reveal a character who is both formidable and human.<br/><br/>Supporting Cast:The ensemble elevates the material. Each actor brings texture, nuance, and purpose, turning even small roles into memorable pivots in the story.<br/><br/>Villain/Antagonist: Written with psychological depth, the antagonist is never a caricature. The tension arises from genuine understanding of motive, making confrontations electric and morally complex.<br/><br/>Direction and Craft\nThe director orchestrates a symphony of tension and tenderness. Visual storytelling is lush yet purposeful-mesmerizing cinematography, purposeful blocking, and a keen eye for detail that rewards repeat viewing. The score is not merely accompaniment; it&#39;s a co-protagonist that amplifies emotion and suspense without ever."

The injected chain on the Indian person skin, was so so scary, that was beyond imagination. I have watched on 6 dec 2025 still there is goosebumps by remembering that scene.

Directed with strong vision and intensity, the film delivers a gripping blend of espionage, drama, and raw emotion. It follows a dangerous mission filled with betrayal, hidden agendas, and relentless pursuit, making it a compelling watch for fans of serious thrillers.<br/><br/>The movie shines brightest in its action sequences. Every fight scene feels powerful, well-choreographed, and grounded in realism. Whether it&#39;s close-combat hand-to-hand action or explosive gun battles, Dhurandar maintains an adrenaline-filled pace throughout. The cinematography adds to the film&#39;s gritty appeal, capturing the tension and fear of a spy&#39;s life with dark tones and sharp visuals. Background music is another strong element, enhancing the suspense without overshadowing the storytelling.<br/><br/>Performances are solid across the board. The lead actor delivers one of his most intense roles yet-balancing vulnerability with strength. Supporting characters add depth to the narrative, each contributing significantly to the mission&#39;s twists and emotional beats. Antagonists are equally well-portrayed, with their motivations rooted in realism rather than exaggerated villainy.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandar truly excels is in its storytelling rhythm. The screenplay is tightly structured, revealing secrets and surprises at just the right moments. The film explores themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and patriotism, but does not drown in melodrama. Instead, it uses emotions to strengthen the urgency of the mission.<br/><br/>The movie does run on the longer side, and a few scenes might feel stretched, but the overall intensity keeps the momentum alive. The climax is thrilling, dramatic, and satisfying-delivering the emotional punch a film like this deserves."

                  "plaidHtml": "Dhurandar&quot; is a gripping action-drama inspired by real incidents, though the core premise may feel familiar to viewers because a similar storyline was earlier explored in Mission Majnu. Despite that, the film manages to stand strong on its own with engaging execution and impressive performances.<br/><br/>The movie is visually striking, and every character is crafted with attention to detail. Ranbir Singh delivers one of his most impactful roles, both in terms of looks and emotional presence. The supporting cast fits their parts well, enhancing the film&#39;s overall intensity.<br/><br/>The action sequences are commendable, though one slight drawback is that Ranbir Singh&#39;s action could have been more hard-hitting-something closer to the raw power seen in KGF 2 with Rocky&#39;s character. Another minor negative is that while Sanjay Dutt plays a strong and dominant role, his one-on-one encounter with Akshay Khanna feels oddly imbalanced, reducing the weight of his character.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the music album is excellent, with &quot;Ishq Jalakar&quot; standing out as a soulful, unforgettable track that elevates the emotional depth of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, &quot;Dhurandar&quot; is a well-made, entertaining film with solid performances, great visuals, and memorable music. Despite a few shortcomings, it remains a highly enjoyable watch for action lovers.<br/><br/>⭐ IMDb Rating (My Opinion): 8/10."

He just lived his character. Sanjay Datt again deliverd impecful performance as usual. Arjum Rampal is damn good, he is cruel you will always hate him for his performance. Ranveer singh as a lead superb. His body language, acting impression everything top class. One of his all time best performance. What a excellent music this movie is carrying specially title song and BGM absolutely top notch. Movie divided into 8 parts and every part was so engaging and powerful. A Raw and powerful movie. #DhurandharReview 4.5* A must watch!"

And silver lining too all of the above was the music. Loved this brilliant movie and now eagerly waiting for the next part."

At 3.5 hours, it never drags-every minute immerses you in the dark underworld of Karachi, inspired by real events like IC-814, Parliament attack, and 26/11. Ranveer Singh delivers a career-defining performance as undercover agent Hamza, with brooding intensity and nuance. Akshaye Khanna steals the show as the swaggering Rehman Dakait, explosive in every scene.<br/><br/>The stellar cast, R. Madhavan, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, and Sara Arjun-adds immense depth. Dhar&#39;s direction is visionary, visceral action, intelligent screenplay, stunning cinematography, and a haunting score. It&#39;s bold, unapologetic, and honors unsung heroes while thrilling audiences.<br/><br/>Verdict: 10/10 - A masterpiece redefining Bollywood. Essential big-screen watch!"

At its core, it&#39;s a spy thriller-India&#39;s covert response to the relentless terror attacks originating from Pakistan. It&#39;s structured as a two-part story, with the second chapter still to come.<br/><br/>Every character is given a proper backstory, and the film does justice to each one. The entire cast brings their A-game, and it shows. The background score hits the right notes, and the songs actually serve the narrative instead of interrupting it.<br/><br/>Be warned: the movie is bloody, and it embraces its &quot;A&quot; rating without hesitation.<br/><br/>If there&#39;s any criticism, it&#39;s the runtime. While I personally didn&#39;t feel the length-because I was fully engrossed-a tighter edit of 20-25 minutes might have elevated it even further.<br/><br/>Note - Real review refined by AI."

The BGM is awesome and really elevates the scenes.<br/><br/>The part I liked the most is that they used real facts and showed them on screen without any hesitation.<br/><br/>And the funny part? They give us a disclaimer about the movie... and then completely forget about it in the very first scene 😄"
