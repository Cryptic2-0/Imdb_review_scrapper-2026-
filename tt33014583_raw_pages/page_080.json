The lead&#39;s performance is both commanding and vulnerable, making the character deeply relatable despite the high-stakes environment. Supporting actors add depth and emotional weight, making every subplot meaningful. The director demonstrates remarkable vision, orchestrating a story that intertwines politics, crime, and personal ambition with razor-sharp precision. The action sequences are choreographed meticulously, enhancing the intensity of the plot rather than serving as mere spectacle. What makes the film truly remarkable is its attention to detail-from lighting to camera angles, each scene reinforces the tone of tension, intrigue, and drama. The screenplay also smartly incorporates real-world events, giving the story credibility and urgency. This film is a rare combination of intelligent writing, expert direction, and unforgettable performances."

                  "plaidHtml": "Every frame of the film is meticulously crafted, blending realism, tension, and cinematic spectacle. Ranveer Singh delivers an extraordinary performance, his eyes, posture, and dialogue conveying a nuanced internal struggle while driving the story forward with intensity. Sanjay Dutt&#39;s gravitas dominates, making each of his appearances unforgettable, while Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan anchor the ensemble with measured, intelligent performances that reveal the stakes of the story without unnecessary drama. Arjun Rampal&#39;s menacing calm maintains a continuous tension, contrasting sharply with Sara Arjun&#39;s emotional vulnerability, which humanizes the larger narrative. Director Aditya Dhar choreographs action sequences, suspenseful confrontations, and narrative twists with precision, ensuring that the story remains taut and engaging. Cinematography captures the beauty and brutality of the underworld, while the musical score enhances suspense and emotional beats alike. By the climax, the film delivers both adrenaline-fueled thrills and profound emotional satisfaction."

The background score is great. The runtime is long but it never feels stretched. The set design, the action sequences are done remarkably well and the direction, screenplay is outstanding. There is nothing bad to say about the movie. If the story is good and there are no un necessary subplots, I don&#39;t mind seating for even 4 hours. More of these kind of movies need to be made in bollywood. Can&#39;t wait for the second part."

Director Aditya Dhar has proved this once again.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is one of the best Indian movies ever made and surely one of the finest espionage films in Bollywood. The movie has an excellent screenplay, powerful action sequences, stunning cinematography, and outstanding performances by the entire cast-especially Ranveer Singh, Akshaye Khanna, Arjun Rampal, Rakesh Bedi, Danish Pandor, Sanjay Dutt, R. Madhavan, and Sara Arjun. Special credit also goes to editor Shivkumar Panicker.<br/><br/>Above all, Aditya Dhar deserves huge appreciation. After Uri: The Surgical Strike and Article 370, he has once again broken his own records. With Dhurandhar, he has set a new benchmark and raised the standard of Indian cinema.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-watch for everyone. It shows the harsh reality of the Pakistani government-how it oppresses and manipulates its own citizens and promotes terrorism against India. It also highlights the sacrifices of RAW agents, who give their lives and souls for the motherland, and exposes how some corrupt Indian politicians sell their conscience and compromise the nation&#39;s integrity.<br/><br/>A powerful, bold, and unforgettable film. 🇮🇳🎬"
