Sanjay dutt and Arjun Rampal have killed it in the villain roles and you are bound to hate them in such crafted and goated art piece of their acting.

Ranveer acting with the eyes was exceptional, Akshay Khanna with his swag and that wry smile nailed it, Arjun Rampal was spine chilling with his voice modulation and subtle gestures, and Sanju Baba was what Sanju used to do earlier. Madhavan in a fragmented appearance was expressive with his eyes and facial features. The side actors were also good specially Rakesh Bedi and the actor who played Donga (who played Ranbir&#39;s boss in Rocket Singh).<br/><br/>The set design, production, and the colour grading was brilliant. The amount of research that has gone into this is awesome. Cinematography and Direction and the sets of Lyari town along with Ranveer, Akshaye and Arjun made this movie and exceptional watch for me. The only downside was the bit predictability in the screenplay and the editing was slack, the movie could have been cut by 15 minutes.<br/><br/>But do watch Dhurandhar, this is what an espionage movie should be. Eagerly waiting for 19th March, 2026."

The film honestly reveals uncomfortable truths and highlights how political negligence and poor leadership in the past led to losses and suffering for our brave heroes. It powerfully portrays how the system failed them and how the country paid the price.<br/><br/>There are strong moments that show how decisions taken during earlier governments affected national security, and how our soldiers and spies were left to bear the consequences.

Rooted in the spirit of the soil and driven by an unflinching sense of duty, the movie channels a powerful nationalist fervor that resonates long after the screen fades to black. It speaks in the language of sacrifice, resolve, and unwavering belief in the idea of the nation.<br/><br/>At its core, DHURANDHAR celebrates the strength of character that defines true patriotism. The narrative moves with intensity, portraying individuals who rise above personal comfort to answer a larger call-one that demands courage, discipline, and moral clarity. Without resorting to hollow slogans, the film builds its nationalism through actions, choices, and consequences. This grounded approach makes the emotion feel earned and deeply authentic.<br/><br/>Visually, the film reinforces its message with strong compositions and an earthy palette that anchors the story in lived reality. The background score complements the mood, elevating moments of tension and pride without overpowering the narrative. Dialogues are sharp and purposeful, carrying the weight of conviction rather than theatrics.<br/><br/>What makes DHURANDHAR stand out is its refusal to romanticize nationalism superficially. Instead, it portrays patriotism as responsibility-towards land, people, and values. The characters are not flawless heroes; they are determined citizens shaped by struggle, loss, and an unbreakable sense of belonging. This human depth lends credibility to the film&#39;s ideological stance.<br/><br/>In a time when national identity is often reduced to noise, DHURANDHAR reminds us that the nation is built by silent perseverance and fearless action. It urges viewers to reflect on their own role within the collective, making the experience both stirring and introspective.<br/><br/>DHURANDHAR is a bold cinematic statement-raw, resolute, and deeply Indian. It stands tall as a film that doesn&#39;t just entertain, but ignites pride and responsibility in equal measure."

The film stays engaging from start to finish and is absolutely worth watching."

The film combines powerful performances, gripping storytelling, and a dark, intense atmosphere that pulls you straight into its world. Ranveer Singh delivers one of his most controlled and impressive roles, while Akshaye Khanna completely steals the show with his commanding presence.<br/><br/>The movie&#39;s scale, background score, and action scenes make it a true big-screen experience. Every chapter feels engaging, and the tension never really drops. Even though the film is long, it rarely feels boring because each moment adds something meaningful to the narrative.<br/><br/>What makes Dhurandhar stand out is its boldness. It&#39;s not a typical masala film - it&#39;s raw, gritty, emotional, and surprisingly immersive. If you enjoy intense thrillers with strong characters and a solid storyline, this one delivers everything you&#39;d hope for. An excellent, must-watch movie."
