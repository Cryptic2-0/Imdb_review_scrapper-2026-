Aditya Dhar directs with finesse, orchestrating suspenseful build-up, character-driven drama, and large-scale action sequences.

It&#39;s not Like one hero killing 10 -50 people at a time. We can clearly see the anger on his face with fear.<br/><br/>Technical:- Technically well executed, Cinematography, Editing, Dialogue etc.<br/><br/>Acting:- what an Acting, while watching movie we hate Akshay Khanna, that is ACTUALLY acting. No character is seen like Acting, we feel like they are actually the real character.<br/><br/>Verdict:- must watch for everyone. And Appreciate this kind of movie. Start to End the real Experience."

Yes and it could&#39;ve been cut way shorter if not for the love story angle, but it is a trademark of bollywood so what can you expect. The characters are introduced a bit hastily but each actor gives a marvelous performance. This focuses more on the story of Akshay Khanna and Ranveer Singh&#39;s character and they carried the film. The action sequences are brilliant, the choreography, the violence, and the music, just diabolical. And the ending, if the first half feels draggy, it all pays off in this wonderfully crafted climax, and it has a twist many people did see coming, but many did not. Overall, a movie worthy of all the hype, not just another animal."

Scored at 8 out of 10, the film stands out for its confident direction, atmospheric tension, and a lead performance that elevates nearly every scene.<br/><br/>The story follows its central character-an enigmatic, morally complex figure whose past haunts every decision he makes. The writing excels in the way it balances his inner conflict with high-stakes external threats. Instead of relying only on action, the film invests time into building his personal relationships, motivations, and vulnerabilities. This makes the emotional beats feel genuinely earned.<br/><br/>Visually, Dhurandhar is impressive. The cinematography creates a gritty yet cinematic world, with well-composed shots and fluid action sequences that avoid unnecessary over-stylization. The background score complements the tone without overpowering it, and the pacing, though occasionally uneven in the second half, stays engaging overall.<br/><br/>Performances are one of the film&#39;s strongest pillars. The lead actor brings depth and intensity, portraying the character&#39;s turmoil with subtlety. The supporting cast also shines, especially in moments where the film slows down to explore trust, betrayal, and survival.<br/><br/>Where Dhurandhar falters slightly is in its predictability during a few key twists. Some plot points follow familiar genre beats, and certain characters could have benefited from more development. However, these shortcomings don&#39;t take away from the overall experience, which remains consistently entertaining.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Dhurandhar delivers a compelling combination of storytelling, action, and emotion. With strong performances and a gripping narrative at its core, it earns a solid 8/10-a must-watch for fans of stylish thrillers with substance."

Every word adds something tension, emotion, depth.<br/><br/>Zero boring moments.<br/><br/>The vibe is dark, gritty, and insanely immersive.<br/><br/>From the music to the visuals, everything pulls you deeper into the story.<br/><br/>Overall, Dhurandhar is bold and refreshing. A proper &quot;do something different&quot; film. If you like raw storytelling, stylish violence, and dialogues that actually matter, this one hits perfectly<br/><br/><ul><li>Mitesh Panchal.</li></ul>"

You&#39;ll rob them of the experience.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Most importantly, stop asking around and being afraid of booking tickets. Good or bad, decide for yourself.</li></ul><br/><br/>This movie is a collaboration, a team work. It refuses to ride on just the star power of the actors. Every script writer, lyricist, cinematographer, supporting actor, set designer, sound designer, editor, makeup artist, hair stylist, costume designer, and the long credit list have done a fab job! They all came and gave their 2000% to give us audiences a ride of a lifetime!<br/><br/>I went to watch this movie before any reviews were out. First day, 3rd show. I&#39;m also not into celeb worship. So, the only motivation was to purely experience a Bollywood movie. And MAN! It. Did. Not. Disappoint.<br/><br/>What you see in the trailer, is what you get for 3.5 hours. By the end, you&#39;ll want to keep wanting more. No, and I mean, no OTT, piracy, small screen phones, laptops can replicate the experience. Heck, I didn&#39;t even realise Ranveer&#39;s eye color had changed while watching the trailer. It&#39;s these details that just pop out on a big screen.<br/><br/>Aditya Dhar has created a masterpiece through and through!<br/><br/>The depth and detail of the world of Lyari stays with you long after (in my case 5 days atp)...you just won&#39;t be able to shrug it off.<br/><br/>My soul has been craving for an immersive escape and Dhurandhar delivers like it&#39;s nobody business. You&#39;re hooked, you&#39;re connected, you&#39;re rooting for the protagonist but acting so goated, you&#39;re also rooting for the antagonist. And then they remind you, with real clips of how our agents feel working in the depths of a place with no moral compass. The anger, the shock, the intensity will keep you on the edge.<br/><br/>If you think you won&#39;t watch the movie because of your ideological stance, well you&#39;re smart to see through it. But don&#39;t lose out on an experience of a lifetime."

Ranveer Singh&#39;s layered performance drives the story forward, showing his character&#39;s vulnerability and cunning in equal measure. Sanjay Dutt commands every scene with gravitas, his expressions conveying unspoken history and authority. Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan enhance key sequences, their calculated dialogue delivery heightening suspense. Arjun Rampal&#39;s understated menace keeps the audience constantly uneasy, and Sara Arjun&#39;s poignant moments humanize the stakes. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction balances multiple plotlines seamlessly, blending tense strategy scenes with breathtaking action. Cinematography captures sprawling cityscapes and claustrophobic interiors with equal precision, while the score amplifies emotional beats without overpowering them. Every twist feels earned, and the final act delivers a payoff that is both emotionally satisfying and adrenaline-charged."
