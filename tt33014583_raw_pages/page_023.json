QUite refreshing indeed and that&#39;s the reason for my high rating."

The subject was very interesting, and the performances by all the actors were great. The screenplay could have been better, though.<br/><br/>However, the major flaws were in the art direction. Although Pakistan was portrayed almost correctly, the movie could have been much better with more accurate detailing. I noticed a Bajaj Pulsar, Bajaj Auto rickshaw (during a major sequence), and Tata buses and trucks - automobiles found here in India, not Pakistan. With the kind of budget they spent, they could have created a far more realistic portrayal of Pakistan."

Akshaye Khanna, R Madhavan, and Arjun Rampal add depth and unpredictability, each contributing to a story where every choice feels consequential. Sara Arjun&#39;s presence provides a poignant contrast, her innocence highlighting the stakes of a world steeped in power and betrayal. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction balances meticulous world-building with adrenaline-pumping sequences, ensuring that the long runtime never feels indulgent. The cinematography captures Karachi&#39;s underworld with eerie authenticity, and the sound design amplifies tension without overshadowing the performances. The film&#39;s second half escalates beautifully, delivering both spectacle and emotional resonance that lingers long after the screen goes dark."

From the first frame, the movie reminds you exactly why mass cinema exists: to make you whistle, clap, scream, and forget the world for 3.5 hours. What a movie. And honestly, after watching it, you&#39;ll find yourself waiting for Part 2 like your life depends on it. Durandar isn&#39;t just a film - it&#39;s a full-blown cinematic punch that refuses to let you breathe. From the first explosive frame, the movie reminds you exactly why mass cinema exists: to make you whistle, clap, scream, and forget the world for 3.5 straight hours.<br/><br/>What works instantly is the film&#39;s unapologetic confidence. It doesn&#39;t waste a second convincing you of its madness - it throws you right into a world charged with intensity, swagger, and relentless momentum. The hero&#39;s presence is electric, the kind that makes the audience whistle even before he says a word. And the film milks that aura brilliantly without ever feeling repetitive.<br/><br/>The writing keeps things tight and engaging. Even without revealing a single plot point, it&#39;s fair to say the film balances drama, action, and emotion with a surprisingly smooth flow. Every scene feels like it&#39;s building toward something bigger, making you lean forward, curious about what the next punch, line, or twist will bring.<br/><br/>The music and background score deserve their own applause. They elevate ordinary moments into goosebump-worthy experiences and turn high-voltage scenes into pure euphoria. Cinematography is equally charged, capturing mass action with clarity and style.<br/><br/>What truly makes Durandar stand out is its energy. It doesn&#39;t drop. Not even for a moment. This is the kind of film that celebrates heroism in its most dramatic form, yet still keeps enough emotional depth to stay grounded.<br/><br/>Verdict:\nAn explosive, addictive, high-octane entertainer that grips you from start to finish. If you love mass cinema, this one will stay with you long after the credits roll."

What truly sets it apart is its unapologetic honesty; it doesn&#39;t glamorize the life of an agent, but instead shows the harsh, chilling, and often heartbreaking reality behind the shadows they operate in.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivers a phenomenal performance as Hamza Ali Mazhari (also a potential connection to Aditya Dhar&#39;s directed movie URI), a character inspired by multiple real-life missions carried out by India&#39;s intelligence community. While the role is fictionalized, it carries the soul, grit, and silent bravery of countless RAW operatives who have risked everything for the country. His portrayal feels lived-in every expression, every decision, every moment of anguish reflects the weight of duty these agents carry.<br/><br/>The film keeps you on edge, giving you chills, anger, even helplessness at times, only to later reward you with the deep satisfaction of justice served. It&#39;s a powerful reminder of the immense horror, danger, and emotional toll an agent undergoes, and yet how firmly they stand by their kartavya.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Aditya Dhar. His direction is sharp, immersive, and respectful. The execution is top-tier, and the storytelling stays true to the spirit of those unsung heroes. He balances intensity with emotion, ensuring the narrative never loses its heart.<br/><br/>In short: Dhurandhar is a must watch.<br/><br/>A bold, gripping, and honorable tribute to the brave individuals who protect the nation from the shadows."
