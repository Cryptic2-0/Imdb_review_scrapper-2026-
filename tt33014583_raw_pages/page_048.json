It feels grounded yet massive in scale.<br/><br/>Music: Shashwat Sachdev has outdone himself. The way the soundtrack integrates with the tension-especially the use of those classic ghazals and high-energy tracks-makes the 214-minute runtime fly by.<br/><br/>Action: Unlike the usual &quot;gravity-defying&quot; stunts, the action here feels raw and realistic. The car chases and the tension in the Karachi sequences are world-class.<br/><br/>Performances: Ranveer Singh&#39;s restrained performance as Hamza is a career-best, and Akshaye Khanna as Rehman Dakait is absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>The Verdict: &quot;Jordar Movie Che!&quot; It&#39;s not just a spy thriller; it&#39;s a landmark for Indian Cinema. If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, you are missing out on a masterpiece."

The hero doesn&#39;t waste time delivering lectures on secularism or climate change while terrorists are blowing things up, he just gets the job done with bullets, punches, and zero apologies.<br/><br/>Perfect for anyone with a functioning brain and a spine.<br/><br/>Avoid if you get triggered by the Indian flag.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for sane audiences. Left-liberals, kindly skip, your blood pressure will thank you."

There&#39;s no loud drama, no over-the-top shouting - just pure, controlled, razor-sharp acting. The way he uses his eyes, his pauses, that calm but dangerous energy... he makes every scene feel tense even when he&#39;s just standing quietly in the frame. Whenever he comes on screen, the whole film suddenly feels more serious and important.<br/><br/>The movie itself is gripping - dark, pacy, and engaging from start to finish. The plot has enough twists to keep you hooked, the action scenes are well done, and the world of politics, crime, and power games feels very real. The background score and visuals add a lot to the mood, too.<br/><br/>But for me, this is Akshaye Khanna&#39;s film.<br/><br/>He doesn&#39;t just play the character, he owns it. It&#39;s the kind of performance that reminds you how underrated he actually is and makes you want to see him in many more lead roles.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re a fan of strong acting and intense thrillers, Dhurandhar is a definite must-watch. 10/10, especially for Akshaye Khanna&#39;s brilliant performance."

The film pulls you in quietly and keeps tightening its grip through strong writing and a steadily building screenplay that never feels rushed. Ranveer Singh completely disappears into his role, bringing intensity, vulnerability, and moral conflict in a way that feels very real. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is confident and grounded, balancing action with reflective moments that add depth instead of just spectacle. Performances by Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, R. Madhavan, Sara Arjun, and Manav Gohil add weight and realism, making the world of crime, politics, and espionage feel lived-in. The cinematography and sound design enhance the tension without overpowering it, and the layered storytelling keeps you engaged till the very end. Watching this unfold on the big screen for the first time made the experience intense, emotional, and unforgettable, and it&#39;s a film that genuinely stays with you long after it ends."

Despite its long runtime of nearly 3 hours and 30 minutes, the movie never once feels exhausting - a rare achievement in itself. The narration flows with confidence, making the audience completely surrender to its world.<br/><br/>The music is beautifully integrated into the storytelling. The songs arrive naturally, enhancing emotions rather than interrupting the pace. The background score is one of the film&#39;s strongest assets - intense, haunting, and powerful - it amplifies every dramatic moment and elevates the film to a grand cinematic experience.<br/><br/>What truly sets Dhurandhar apart is its stellar casting. Ranveer Singh dominates the screen with a performance full of intensity and raw energy. Sanjay Dutt brings gravitas and authority, making his presence felt in every scene. Akshaye Khanna impresses with his restrained and layered acting, while R. Madhavan adds emotional depth and balance to the narrative. Each actor fits their role perfectly, making the characters feel lived-in and real.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is striking. Strong cinematography, detailed frames, and sharp editing ensure that the pace never dips. The screenplay is tightly woven, keeping the tension alive throughout and making the lengthy runtime feel surprisingly crisp.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:\nDhurandhar is not just a film, but an experience - powerful performances, stirring music, and confident storytelling come together to deliver a gripping cinematic journey that never feels long. A must-watch for those who enjoy grand, intense cinema."

I watched it on a large screen in Brisbane, and the 7:50 pm show was a full house, which is quite rare here, that alone says a lot.<br/><br/>The director deserves massive credit for giving every character equal importance. Not a single role felt like a supporting one; each character had a crucial part to play, and the actors delivered accordingly.<br/><br/>One of the most impressive aspects was the casting. Actors who are mostly known for comedy were given serious, intense roles, and it worked brilliantly. Dhar truly saw the untapped potential in Gaurav Gera and Rakesh Bedi, and it was refreshing and powerful to watch them in such a new light.<br/><br/>Akshaye Khanna, R. Madhavan, and Arjun Rampal were solid as always, they never disappoint. Ranveer Singh once again proved that he&#39;s an exceptional actor who just needs the right director to bring out his best. He should definitely do more films like this. Sanjay Dutt also did a great job.<br/><br/>That said, the real star of the film is the director and the story writer, who brought together such an engaging vision and gripping narrative.

It shows the world exactly as it is: the politics, the hidden motives, the moral grey areas, and how good people get crushed when they&#39;re not smart enough to navigate the system.<br/><br/>The storytelling is tight, the performances are brutally honest, and the message is loud without being preachy. What makes the movie stand out is that nothing feels exaggerated for drama - these are the kind of situations people actually face but never talk about openly.<br/><br/>If someone wants entertainment with truth, this is it. Dhurandhar is a reminder that the world is not as simple or fair as we like to pretend. It&#39;s absolutely worth watching."
