Rather than giving you adrenaline rush in every frame by some unnecessary action ,the film gradually opens and slowly takes over you.<br/><br/>A good storytelling, compelling screenplay, power packed performances, absolute banger bgm&#39;s and believable action sequences.<br/><br/>In short &quot;dhamaka&quot;\nA slightly gory for the faint hearted."

Sanjay Dutt&#39;s scenes resonate with authority and menace, often stealing the frame with a single glance. Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan add depth, their interactions loaded with subtext and quiet intensity. Arjun Rampal&#39;s subtle threats loom over the narrative, creating a constant sense of danger. Sara Arjun&#39;s emotional presence offers a tender counterbalance to the violent world around her. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction orchestrates suspenseful sequences with surgical precision, making action scenes feel both thrilling and consequential. The cinematography highlights contrasts between urban chaos and intimate character moments, while the soundtrack punctuates tension, amplifying every heartbeat. The climax ties together narrative threads with satisfying emotional and visual impact."

The plot is rich and consistently engaging, the writing is razor-sharp, and every character is rendered with striking nuance. Its sincere, steadily intensifying screenplay pulls you in deeper with each scene.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh completely transforms for this role, and the supporting cast - Akshaye Khanna, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Rampal, R. Madhavan, Sara Arjun, Manav Gohil, and others - ensure the film never falters for a moment. Aditya Dhar crafts a world so authentic and immersive that you can almost feel yourself walking the streets alongside the characters. His integration of real-life-style footage and grounded sound design leads to several chilling moments, including a standout sequence where the screen bleeds red and haunting recorded voices echo through an attack.<br/><br/>In the end, Dhurandhar is both edge-of-your-seat and emotionally resonant - cinema meant to be experienced in a full theatre. And with that tantalizing final note, the wait for March 2026 to see what Aditya Dhar and Ranveer Singh unveil next feels almost unbearable."

Ranveer Singh portrays a conflicted protagonist with precision, seamlessly switching between vulnerability and calculated aggression. Sanjay Dutt adds a formidable presence, anchoring the narrative with gravitas. Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan offer nuanced performances, while Arjun Rampal exudes a quiet menace that lingers. Sara Arjun&#39;s emotional authenticity heightens the stakes. Under Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction, action sequences are purposeful and dramatic, each adding to the story rather than feeling gratuitous. Cinematography and sound design amplify suspense, culminating in a climax that is both thrilling and emotionally satisfying."

Ranveer Singh delivers a restrained, powerful performance as the undercover agent Hamza. Akshaye Khanna, as the gangster Rehman Dakait, is often hailed as a scene-stealer, matching the lead with his chilling presence.&quot;\n2. Direction &amp; Vision,8/10,&quot;Aditya Dhar&#39;s Ambitious Scale. The film is lauded for its ambitious, large-scale direction and a clear vision that weaves a gritty spy thriller with a Godfather-esque underworld saga.&quot;\n3. World Building,9/10,&quot;Immersive and Gritty. The detailed recreation of Karachi&#39;s Lyari gangwar and the complex nexus of crime, politics, and the ISI is considered a major strength, making the world feel authentic and dangerous.&quot;\n4. Screenplay &amp; Plot,7/10,&quot;Compelling, but Stretched. The narrative is gripping and complex, inspired by real events like the Kandahar hijacking and 26/11. However, many critics felt the writing gets stretched in the first half, spending too much time on setup.&quot;\n5. Runtime &amp; Pacing,5/10,&quot;Excessively Long. With a runtime of approximately 3 hours and 34 minutes, it&#39;s one of the longest Indian films. The pacing is uneven, which is a major drawback, though the film rarely feels tedious for those invested in the story.&quot;\n6. Music &amp; BGM,8/10,&quot;Scintillating Score. The background score and music, which cleverly blend old classics with modern soundscapes, are a triumph that effectively elevates the film&#39;s intense mood and relentless pulse.&quot;\n7. Action &amp; Violence,7/10,&quot;Raw and Unflinching. The action sequences are brutal and grounded, contributing to the film&#39;s realism. The violence is unapologetic, adding to the intense tone, though some scenes were noted for poor VFX.&quot;\n8. Technical Aspects,8/10,&quot;High Production Value. The cinematography is spectacular, and the production design is realistic and fabulous, lending a top-notch craft quality to the film. Editing is decent but flagged as not top-notch in places.&quot;\n9. Emotional Core,7/10,&quot;Patriotism with Subtlety. The film manages to convey the emotional toll and stress of the spy&#39;s life effectively. It touches on patriotism and national security without relying solely on jingoism, focusing on character-driven stakes.&quot;\n10. Climax &amp; Sequel Setup,9/10,&quot;Intense Cliffhanger. The film ends on an explosive and masterful twist that completely re-contextualizes the lead character and sets the stage perfectly for the confirmed Part 2, leaving the audience highly anticipating the sequel.&quot;"
