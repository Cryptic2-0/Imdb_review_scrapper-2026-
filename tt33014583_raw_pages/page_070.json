There&#39;s an intensity to him that doesn&#39;t scream for attention but still dominates every frame. After a while, you stop seeing &quot;Ranveer the star&quot; and start seeing a man who looks dangerous, unpredictable, and mentally ten steps ahead of everyone else. His eyes do half the acting - cold, sharp, and unsettling - and that&#39;s what makes the character stick.<br/><br/>The hype isn&#39;t just about action or scale; it&#39;s about how restrained yet explosive he feels. When he finally snaps, it hits harder because of the calm he carries before it. This role reminds people why Ranveer is considered one of the most fearless performers of his generation - he doesn&#39;t play safe, he commits fully. Dhurandhar feels less like a comeback and more like a statement: Ranveer Singh is back, and he&#39;s not here to be comfortable, he&#39;s here to be unforgettable 🔥"

The movie is supposed to be lengthy but when you&#39;re in the theatre watching the movie, you don&#39;t even realise when the 3.34 hours were up. The movie got the entire theatre whooping &amp; cheering at the end. It tells you how crisp and perfect the direction &amp; narration were. Some of the real life events that Dhar cleverly interwove with the story was honestly beautiful. It hits you hard. How much we have lost. How many lives were lost especially because of our own people. While the direction is clearly the star of the movie, the actors are not far behind. Ranveer Singh proved yet again why he&#39;s the most versatile actor of his generation. He proved yet again how he is an actor with a calibre no other current generation or his can come close to. Especially in the first half, the character needs subtlety &amp; patience. He delivers so well. You only see Hamsa on the screen throughout. Madhavan, Akshay &amp; Arjun were each terrific in the respective roles that they play. Each of their characters get an arc and a story that they don&#39;t feel like side characters which is also something Aditya did well. The movie does so well to not just tell the story &amp; sacrifice behind every single brave heart that sacrifice everything for the country but he does it in a way that keeps the audience engaged &amp; invested. He ensured we leave the theatres feeling extremely proud yet also a little ashamed that we weren&#39;t aware of things that had before transpired or contributed to the silence that once was part of India&#39;s response to anything Terror related.<br/><br/>There is one sentence that actually is powerful.<br/><br/>&quot;Pakistan has always been India&#39;s second biggest problem, it&#39;s first problem are the very people that it tries to protect&quot;<br/><br/>The movie has references to the governments lack or response or wanting a government that&#39;s brave to respond to the terrorists in their own language but if you want to call it nationalism or anti Pakistan or pro-BJP that&#39;s you trying to run away from the truth. Propaganda is when you sell lies, not when you speak the truth."

Yes, it&#39;s dramatized , because it&#39;s cinema, not a courtroom document.. but the core is unmistakably clear. And let&#39;s be honest: the Indian audience isn&#39;t naïve. Public hai, sab jaanti hai.<br/><br/>What&#39;s ironic is how the movie stayed in the crosshairs of so-called &quot;intellectual&quot; reviewers and even a certain loud German Shepherd from YouTube only for their outrage to backfire spectacularly.

Cinematography captures both chaos and stillness, making every scene visually compelling and narratively rich."

                  "plaidHtml": "Dhurandhar is built on a genre I care about deeply: the serious spy thriller - closer to Body of Lies or The Departed than to the usual glossy &quot;RAW loves ISI anti-hero&quot; template that Hindi cinema keeps recycling.<br/><br/>For years, our films have been oddly shy about showing Pakistan&#39;s deep-state ecosystem for what it is.<br/><br/>We either romanticise it, or soften key players into &quot;good at heart but misguided&quot; figures at the very top of a security apparatus that, in reality, has been repeatedly linked to terror networks. Dhurandhar, very deliberately, refuses that soft focus. It treats the Pakistani establishment and its proxies with a cold, clinical lens, while still keeping the story accessible to a mainstream audience. That alone makes it feel like a generational correction.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. At three and a half hours, the film is long on runtime but still feels rushed in parts, as if it&#39;s constantly jumping from frame to frame rather than letting some moments breathe. There is enough material here for three films instead of two, and you can sense that density in how quickly some arcs are wrapped.<br/><br/>Where it really shines is in the writing. The core script and screenplay are sharply structured: real-life antagonists and events are woven with fictional protagonists in a way that feels disturbingly plausible. The Lyari gang wars give the film its spine. We see just enough of that brutality to understand the stakes and the moral rot, but the director stops short of Game of Thrones level gore. That restraint is not timidity; it&#39;s craft.<br/><br/>The direction, overall, is of genuinely international standard. Compressing a brutal, politically loaded reality into one contained narrative, keeping the context clear and the emotional throughline intact across such a long film, is no small feat. The filmmaker has already proved himself with Uri, and this only underlines that he is a craftsperson to track very closely.<br/><br/>The casting is interesting, and uneven.<br/><br/>R. Madhavan is superb as Sanyal, clearly inspired by someone the whole nation really admires. It&#39;s technically a cameo, but he walks in with such quiet authority that the character feels much larger than his screen time.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh&#39;s work here is more complicated to talk about. On the surface, he doesn&#39;t &quot;stand out&quot; - and that is exactly why he works as a spy. If your undercover operative is constantly dancing, showing off, and drawing attention, he&#39;s failing at the job. Dhurandhar does something almost embarrassingly obvious yet rarely done in our cinema: it remembers that spies are meant to disappear into the crowd, not turn espionage into a spectacle. Ranveer leans into that idea. When he is in the backdrop, thinking more than speaking, you get a glimpse of a credible field operative who relies on brain over brute force or CGI heroics. At the same time, his innate screen presence is undeniable; it&#39;s rare among current &quot;stars,&quot; and he remains, purely on craft and range, one of the finest actors of his generation. The jarring contrast, of course, is between that disciplined performance and his often chaotic, attention-seeking public persona - but on screen, in this film, the work holds.<br/><br/>Sara Arjun is competent and does what the part asks, but the romantic or emotional chemistry with Ranveer never fully catches fire. It&#39;s not bad - just oddly flat for what the story could have supported and you will sense that it is not the age-gap that has caused the lapse.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt, for me, is the weak link. He physically resembles the real-world figure he&#39;s based on, which helps, but the performance feels undercooked. You keep wishing someone like Kumud Mishra had been cast instead; he could have brought the same menace with far more nuance.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal and Rakesh Bedi are both on point. Rampal has an ominous, slow-burn presence that clearly sets him up for a larger role in the sequel. Bedi does lecherous and morally greasy exactly the way the part demands, without drifting into caricature.<br/><br/>Danish Pandor is convincing in the limited time he gets. The casting for the Uzair Baloch counterpart is smart: you can see the foundation being laid for a much heavier load in the next film, and he seems ready to carry it.<br/><br/>The show-stealer, though, is Akshaye Khanna. This is his second standout villain turn in the same year, and Dhurandhar cements his comeback. If you don&#39;t know the real man he&#39;s playing, you could believe Khanna is that person. If you do know the reference, you&#39;re still likely to feel he rocked in the role. With very few lines, and a performance built almost entirely on body language, gaze, and timing, he reminds you just how refined an actor of the previous generation he really is.<br/><br/>The craft around the performances is equally solid. The songs and background score are excellent, and the BGM in particular does heavy lifting in tension and mood. Production design is both era-appropriate and class-appropriate - a chronic weakness in many Hindi films. The rich have the kind of high-end gadgets they would plausibly own; street-level characters use basic, believable devices. Nothing feels randomly &quot;fancy&quot; for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The film leaves a lot unsaid and unexplained. Some of that is clearly by design, to hold material back for the next instalment. Some of it feels like a casualty of the already massive runtime.<br/><br/>And then there are the &quot;usual&quot; accusations that get thrown at any unapologetically pro-India narrative.<br/><br/>Is Dhurandhar jingoistic? Not really. If anything, it is far more restrained than the label suggests. There are no chest-thumping speeches, barely any melodramatic breakdowns. The patriotism is mostly in the choices characters make, not in slogans shouted at the camera.<br/><br/>Does it show &quot;too much&quot; Pakistan and &quot;not enough&quot; India? The story is literally about an Indian spy infiltrating a Pakistani gang in one of Karachi&#39;s most notorious spaces. Of course most of the visual canvas is Pakistan. Expecting equal visual time for India here is like complaining that a submarine film shows too much water. If you want pretty postcards of Indian cities, that&#39;s what travel videos are for. This film is about the underbelly across the border.<br/><br/>Is it &quot;anti-secular&quot; because it portrays a mostly Muslim gang in Pakistan as violent and regressive? That criticism skips the basic context: this is not a random community portrait. It&#39;s about gangsters who, in the real world, have been tied to multiple terror incidents. Sanitising them into misunderstood soft anti-heroes would be far more dishonest than showing them as dangerous.<br/><br/>Is it &quot;too violent&quot;? By most expert accounts of Lyari and similar spaces, what&#39;s on screen is perhaps a fraction of the real brutality. Dhurandhar shows enough to disturb, but not enough to numb. That is a conscious artistic choice.<br/><br/>Finally, the film refuses the usual commercial distractions: there are no item numbers parachuted into the plot, no bikini songs on foreign beaches that pause the story for choreography. Real operatives in the field usually live hard, compromised lives; they are not pausing mid-mission for a music video. Dhurandhar respects that reality and, in doing so, respects the audience&#39;s intelligence.<br/><br/>By the end of the year, taken together with Chaava, this stands as one of the strongest Hindi films in the mainstream space - and it&#39;s no coincidence that Akshaye Khanna is central to both. Dhurandhar may be imperfect and occasionally overstuffed, but it does one simple, essential thing that our cinema has been avoiding for years: it uses common sense about what spies are supposed to do - blend in, not perform - and builds a gripping, politically clear story around that truth."
