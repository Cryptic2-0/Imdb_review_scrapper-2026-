Akshaye Khanna is outstanding, especially given how challenging his character is. The mannerisms he adopts are spot-on and elevate the role even further. Ranveer Singh is solid and fits his character well. R. Madhavan appears in a look none of us could&#39;ve ever imagined! He truly is a gem of an actor.<br/><br/>Sanjay Dutt, in my opinion, felt unnecessary. His humour doesn&#39;t land, and his character could&#39;ve easily been removed, though I suppose they wanted someone with a personal agenda against Akshaye Khanna. Rakesh Bedi was excellent in his role, while the new girl could&#39;ve performed better. Gaurav Gera was another surprise! None of us would&#39;ve pictured him in that kind of getup.<br/><br/>The most powerful aspect of the film is how starkly it portrays the gory reality of terrorists - how they think, operate, and inflict fear and &quot;enjoy&quot; watching innocent people die :( It also highlights the immense pressure, pain and challenges the Indian government faces during terrifying times like terrorist attacks.<br/><br/>The movie could easily have been 30-40 minutes shorter. Some of the action sequences are too graphic and difficult to watch. I&#39;ve rated it a 7 primarily because of the excessive gore and the entire Sanjay Dutt segment.<br/><br/>Once again, Akshaye Khanna shines the brightest! He truly deserves multiple accolades for this role. Salute for portraying such a complex character with so much depth and dedication!<br/><br/>Hats off to the entire team and crew. It&#39;s difficult to not clap for their extreme hard work in making this film!"

Ranveer Singh anchors the narrative with a performance full of subtlety and intensity.

Cinematography captures both chaotic urban environments and intimate human moments. The score underscores tension, and by the climax, the story delivers thrilling and emotional payoff."

Not once did I feel bored or disconnected. The movie holds you completely from start to finish.<br/><br/>Cinematography deserves its own praise. Every frame looks thoughtfully composed, capturing emotions, atmospheres, and symbolism in ways that sometimes say more than dialogues ever could. Combined with a stunning background score, the visual experience becomes even richer. The music never overwhelms the scenes; instead, it elevates them, guiding your emotions without ever dictating them."

Sanjay Dutt is as powerful as ever, giving the film gravitas. Akshaye Khanna, R Madhavan, and Arjun Rampal all deliver performances that feel real and natural. Sara Arjun steals hearts with her innocence. The direction by Aditya Dhar is brilliant, balancing complex political and action-packed scenes with simple storytelling. The film&#39;s music, fight sequences, and emotional moments all hit perfectly. A true blockbuster experience."
