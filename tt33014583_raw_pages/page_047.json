I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing or how he does it, but he completely blows the screen away every single time he appears. Even when he&#39;s sharing the frame with big actors, your eyes automatically go only to Akshaye. His presence, his expressions, his vibe - he&#39;s magnetic. Even when he is not speaking, he&#39;s still acting and holding your full attention. We truly need more actors like him in Bollywood.<br/><br/>The movie itself is strong - great performances and very solid character writing. The story could have been a little better, but overall it&#39;s a powerful, engaging watch. For me, the absolute highlight is Akshaye Khanna. He lifts the entire film to another level.<br/><br/>9/10 - Watch it for Akshaye Khanna&#39;s brilliance."

This isn&#39;t just a spy thriller; it&#39;s a gritty, complex underworld saga that uses the espionage framework to explore the brutal realities of covert operations. The film&#39;s strength lies in its refusal to offer easy answers, instead plunging us deep into the perilous world of Lyari, where the lines between criminal, politician, and spy are constantly blurred.<br/><br/>The performances are truly the foundation of this masterpiece. Ranveer Singh as Hamza Ali Mazari delivers a performance defined by restraint and explosive intensity-his transformation from a green operative to a feared figure of authority is a masterclass in controlled acting. But the undeniable show-stealer is Akshaye Khanna as Rehman Dakait. His introduction scene, set to the viral &#39;FA9LA&#39; track, is one of the most electric cinematic moments of the year. He doesn&#39;t shout to exert dominance; he simply is the power, making his character an unforgettable, chilling antagonist.<br/><br/>The film&#39;s runtime is long, but Aditya Dhar utilizes every minute to meticulously build the world and its complex politics, a treatment rarely seen in mainstream Bollywood. The technical departments-from the raw, dusty cinematography to the hard-hitting sound design-deserve special mention for creating such an immersive, unsettling atmosphere.<br/><br/>If you&#39;re looking for a spectacle with depth, incredible performances, and a story that genuinely grips you until the final, shocking tease for the sequel, Dhurandhar is absolutely essential viewing. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible. It&#39;s a bold, brilliant piece of cinema. 🇮🇳🔥\n#DhurandharReview #RanveerSingh #AkshayeKhanna #AdityaDhar #MustWatch."

The main genres are organized crime, spy, romance, and politics. The story&#39;s timeline is built around tragic events, but the story itself is fiction. The story blends the many genres well, switching between them seamlessly. The action is sparse, but well done, with just a bit being over the top. The three-hour and thirty-four-minute runtime flies by and is worth it. This is definitely a movie worth a ticket."

However, this movie should be watched for our nameless heroes who have contributed so much for our nation and get unnoticed!!"
