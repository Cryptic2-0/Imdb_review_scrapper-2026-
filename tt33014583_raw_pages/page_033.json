It&#39;s worth the 3½ hours of your life.<br/><br/>Everything from the legendary casting, raw action sequences to the gritty scenes. Overall, Dhurandhar succeeds because it understands that a thriller is only as strong as its characters. With Akshaye Khanna at the helm, backed by a perfectly tuned cast and gritty realism that stays with you long after the film ends, Dhurandhar is not just a movie-it is an experience well worth watching."

Loosely inspired by real events like Operation Lyari and geopolitical tensions, the film weaves espionage, betrayal, and raw patriotism into a sprawling narrative.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh shines as the conflicted operative, delivering a restrained yet explosive performance full of charisma and vulnerability. He&#39;s brilliantly countered by Akshaye Khanna as the ruthless gang lord Rehman Dakait, whose menacing presence dominates scenes. The ensemble-R. Madhavan as the sharp IB chief Ajay Sanyal (echoing Ajit Doval), Sanjay Dutt as the fearless cop SP Chaudhary Aslam, and Arjun Rampal-adds layers of tension and depth.<br/><br/>Dhar crafts a Godfather-like saga with gritty action, realistic violence, and masterful tradecraft. The cinematography captures Karachi&#39;s shadowy streets evocatively, while Shashwat Sachdev&#39;s thumping score heightens suspense. At 214 minutes, the runtime allows rich world-building and character arcs."

It doesn&#39;t sugarcoat anything . It shows the harsh reality of cross-border aggression and the destructive mindset of those hostile elements. The film captures this with honesty and impact, without feeling exaggerated or filmy.<br/><br/>Ranveer Singh delivered one of his best performances, and the entire cast elevated the narrative beautifully. The action, emotion, intensity - everything landed perfectly for me.<br/><br/>For me, Dhurandhar is not just a movie, it&#39;s an experience. A must-watch for anyone who enjoys powerful, patriotic thrillers with substance."

Dhurandhar absolutely floored me. I genuinely don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s even being compared to Animal. This film is tight, focused, and surprisingly fat-free, despite being 3.5 hours long, a rare brilliance in editing and direction.<br/><br/>That final stretch... goosebumps.<br/><br/>When Akshaye Khanna tells Ranveer to stop the car, and that score kicks in, bro, that moment had me gripping the seat.<br/><br/>This is Aditya Dhar&#39;s magnum opus. He has crafted something bold, emotional, and cinematic without drowning it in noise. Go watch it."

Ranveer Singh anchors the narrative with a performance full of nuance, from quiet investigative moments to explosive action sequences. Sanjay Dutt commands attention in every confrontation, while Akshaye Khanna and R Madhavan deliver understated yet powerful performances. Arjun Rampal&#39;s quiet menace creates constant tension, and Sara Arjun&#39;s emotional depth provides grounding for the audience. Aditya Dhar&#39;s direction is masterful, blending intricate plotting with meticulously choreographed action. Cinematography captures both the sprawling chaos of urban landscapes and intimate human drama, and the score amplifies suspense at every turn. By the finale, the stakes escalate to a breathtaking crescendo, leaving audiences exhilarated and emotionally invested."
