It is intense, gripping, emotional, and crafted on a massive scale. What stands out most is the powerhouse performance by Ranveer Singh, who disappears completely into the character. His raw intensity, vulnerability, and unpredictable energy make the film unforgettable."

                  "plaidHtml": "Aditya Dhar&#39;s Dhurandhar is a long, intense, and ambitious film that has earned strong but divided reactions from both critics and audiences.<br/><br/>A Gritty, Geopolitical Thriller<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of real historical events like the 1999 hijacking and the 2001 Parliament attack, the story follows a RAW agent who goes deep undercover into Karachi&#39;s Lyari underworld to dismantle a gangster-ISI terror nexus. The film is structured into distinct chapters and builds a gritty, complex world of espionage and geopolitical maneuvering.<br/><br/>The Major Strengths<br/><br/>· Powerhouse Performances: The cast is consistently praised as a major highlight. Ranveer Singh delivers a controlled, intense performance, often described as career-best. Akshaye Khanna is frequently called the scene-stealer, bringing a chilling, charismatic menace to his role.<br/><br/>· Technical Craftsmanship: The film is noted for its high production values, visceral action choreography, and a pulsating background score that significantly elevates the tension.<br/><br/>· Immersive World-Building: Director Aditya Dhar is commended for creating a detailed, believable, and ruthless world of Karachi&#39;s underworld and intelligence operations.<br/><br/>Key Points of Criticism<br/><br/>· Demanding Runtime: This is the film&#39;s most debated aspect. With a runtime between 212 to 214 minutes (over 3.5 hours), many reviews note that the narrative feels overstretched, particularly in the first half.<br/><br/>· Uneven Pacing: The slow-burn, deliberate pace of the first hour, dedicated to character and plot setup, tests the patience of some viewers expecting a faster thriller.<br/><br/>· Contested Romantic Subplot: The romantic track between Ranveer Singh&#39;s character and the politician&#39;s daughter (played by Sara Arjun) is seen by some critics as an underwritten element that could have been trimmed.<br/><br/>Final Verdict &amp; Audience<br/><br/>Dhurandhar is not a light, breezy watch. It is a dense, serious-minded spy saga that requires and rewards patience. Most reviews conclude that if you can commit to its epic length and appreciate grounded, performance-driven geopolitical thrillers, it offers a compelling big-screen experience.<br/><br/>However, if you prefer fast-paced, straightforward action or have limited tolerance for very long films, you might find it challenging. The film also ends with a clear setup for a sequel.<br/><br/>I hope this non-spoiler review helps you decide. Are you generally a fan of long-form, detailed storytelling in films, or do you tend to prefer tighter narratives? Knowing this could help me provide more tailored insights."

The film is raw, intense and hits you straight in the gut. The scale is massive, the performances are crazy good (Ranveer and Akshaye Khanna absolutely killed it), and the whole world-building is so real that for a moment you feel like you&#39;re actually standing right inside the chaos.<br/><br/>What I loved the most is that the movie doesn&#39;t shy away from showing the dark truth behind terrorism, politics and how our soldiers and officers actually risk everything. Some scenes are brutal, yes, but they are meant to be brutal. That&#39;s the point - it&#39;s not fake heroism, it&#39;s the real cost of violence.<br/><br/>The cinematography, background score, the long but gripping storyline - everything comes together like a proper cinematic experience we rarely get nowadays. This is not a &quot;timepass movie,&quot; this is one of those films that stays in your head hours after you walk out of the theatre.<br/><br/>India honestly needs more movies like this - fearless, strong and unfiltered. Dhurandhar isn&#39;t perfect, but it is powerful. And in today&#39;s times, that&#39;s more important.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

For all its grandilosque statements, gut wrenching action, torture scenes bordering on savagery, the uniqueness of the plot (?)\nAn impressive cast is not enough.<br/><br/>After a while, the characters were interchangeable. The mannerisms, abuses, dangling cigarettes ( lol), the sneers, were visible. For many Shades and face fuzz acted as a cloak for histrionics!<br/><br/>The vote swayed between bulging biceps, swaying locks, sneery snarl, filthy mouths, beastly mannerisms!<br/><br/>The person who stood out is Rakesh Bedi. He stole the show with his performance. A small but much needed human, comic relief came from him. As for the deeper insight into the politics of the two nations. It is lost in all the unnecessary violence. On a serious note, topics of national security, real threats to our country, need for more, more &amp; much, much more were touched upon in graphic details. How can an average cinegoer, out for entertainment, munching on warm popcorn in the dark help in matters our government fails at is baffling? A documentary would have sufficed. They are planning a sequel; beware!"

This movie by Aditya Dhar presents a Raw and power packed action spy thriller with absolutely well performed by brilliant actors Ranveer, Akshay Khanna, Arjun Rampal and Sanju Baba. But, the one actor that takes the crown of acting is our underrated superstar Akshay Khanna as Rahman Dakait. His silence in between scenes speaks so much that dialogues couldn&#39;t. It&#39;s a pure cinematics experience with the production quality top notch and music and background score taking scenes to a tier above. Shashwat Sachdeva&#39;s music has added the calm and charm to the movie. It&#39;s a long movie but it builds the characters so well that you are hooked to it. Can&#39;t wait for part 2 releasing in March 2026. It&#39;s an absolute must watch cinema experience. So definitely go and enjoy folks!"

                  "plaidHtml": "Dhurandhar mistakes length, noise, and seriousness for intelligence. What it actually delivers is a convoluted spy drama that collapses the moment you stop admiring the background score and ask the most basic question: what was the mission?<br/><br/>The film opens with a hijacking by Jaish, after which Indian intelligence decides the best response is to send a criminal-turned-agent to Karachi to infiltrate a Lyari gang that has nothing to do with Jaish, terrorism, or the hijacking. Why Karachi? Why Lyari? Why this gang? The movie never bothers to explain.<br/><br/>From here, the agent inexplicably helps Rehman Dakait rise in the underworld. This rise then attracts two conveniently placed intermediaries who introduce Rehman to the ISI chief, a chain of events so dependent on blind luck that it accidentally turns espionage into a lottery. Neither the agent, Rehman, nor R&amp;AW plans this. It just... happens. Twice.<br/><br/>Ironically, terrorism only escalates because of the agent&#39;s involvement. Rehman starts supplying weapons to the ISI after the agent embeds himself in the gang. If the goal was to prevent attacks on India, the mission is not just a failure it is actively counterproductive.<br/><br/>At one point, the agent declares his ambition to become the &quot;King of Karachi,&quot; a line that sounds dramatic but leads absolutely nowhere. He neither becomes king, nor dismantles any terror network, nor prevents any attack. Instead, the plot gets distracted by a half-baked romance and ends with the agent assassinating the very man he helped empower.<br/><br/>The film then abruptly ends, as if it suddenly remembered it had been running for over three hours and needed to stop.<br/><br/>Dhurandhar wants to be gritty, intelligent, and epic. It is actually a bloated, poorly thought-out narrative where cause and effect don&#39;t exist, stakes are retroactively invented, and the protagonist&#39;s mission remains unclear even in the final act.<br/><br/>This isn&#39;t slow-burn storytelling.<br/><br/>This isn&#39;t complex espionage.<br/><br/>This is just noise masquerading as depth.<br/><br/>If you remove the performances, the score, and the scale, you&#39;re left with a spy thriller where the spy shouldn&#39;t have been sent in the first place and where the story only works if you don&#39;t think about it at all."
